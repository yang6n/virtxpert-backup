The <a href="http://www.virtualdesignmaster.com/virtual-design-master-episode-2-challenge-2-recording/" target="_blank">first Virtual Design Master challenge</a> is in the books, now its on to the Disaster Recovery challenge.  My design is available below as is the recorded Google+ Hangout.  I'd love feedback on the design, as Chris Wahl mentioned I surely needed more diagrams in this document, and that omission was a conscious decision to leave out as I wanted as much detail in the design within the given time period.  I hope to be able to do a few more in the DR design.
