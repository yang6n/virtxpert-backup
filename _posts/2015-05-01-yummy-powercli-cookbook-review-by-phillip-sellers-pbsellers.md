The <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V8BMWZG/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0" target="_blank">PowerCLI Cookbook</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/pbsellers" target="_blank">Phillip Sellers</a> is an excellent resource for any skill level, whether you are a beginner or looking for a great reference to have with you.

First and foremost, this book far exceeds what I expect out of a technology cookbook. If you step back and think about a (food) cookbook you get the recipe for what you are going to make (i.e. what you are going to do in PowerCLI) and the ingredients to make it (i.e. the cmdlets necessary to perform the task). Phillip took that a step further and began the cookbook with how to actually start the oven, or in this case a simple recipe to connect to vCenter and get started using PowerCLI.

The chapters in the book are laid out very well, starting with basic hosts related tasks, before moving on to vCenter, virtual machines, and other more complex scenarios - the build up in this format makes it excellent for those who are new to PowerCLI, or even VMware for that matter. Each recipie also has a "how it works" section where the components use are explained (no one has ever told me how food flavors work together!).

You could quite literally use the book to just about stand up a complete vSphere environment as all the major topics such as networking, datastores, clusters, and virtual machine management (including using PowerCLI to invoke in guest scrips) is covered.

**Disclaimer - I have a book published with Packt Publishing and spoke to Phillip before he decided to write the book. This book was provided to me by the author but the review was not read, or approved by Phillip, it is simply my opinion on the book and its contents.**
