As everyone gets ready for Thanksgiving in the US I wanted to remind you that Commitmas 2015 is right around the corner. I don’t know what I would have done last year without Commitmas to pull us through. Anyway – uh, Commitmas? Huh, could it be that some of you are not acquainted with the story of Commitmas?

<img class="aligncenter" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commitmas/30-days-of-commitmas-2015/master/octocat/holiday-octocat.png" alt="" width="684" height="467" />

Matthew Brender came up with the idea for Commitmas last year to help people who were new to GitHub to have experience with the platform and learn about what it can do. Well, it is back this year, except  we are taking the 12 Days of Commitmas and expanding the holiday to 30 days! During those 30 days we have lined up presenters for each day of the work week (Mon-Fri) to present on various topics.

It will start with an introduction to GitHub by Matthew Brender and the first few episodes will help everyone new to GitHub get acquanted with the terms and working with tools on their local machine. As the month goes on, you will start to see how GitHub should be part of your normal workflow. You'll see how it can be used with network configs, building web pages and using it with other popular products such as Slack.

Currently there are 4 openings left in the schedule, if you would like to present, please contact either myself or Rob Nelson (<a href="https://twitter.com/rnelson0" target="_blank">@rnelson0</a>) or check out the <a href="https://github.com/commitmas/30-days-of-commitmas-2015" target="_blank">30 Days of Commitmas 2015 schedule over at GitHub</a> where you can also find more details about how to participate. In short, if you are new to GitHub, the goal is to get setup and commit something you learned that day to the README file in your GitHub repository (if none of that makes sense, don't worry it will). For people with more experience, there are other challenges such as working on other projects or contributing to opensource projects, as well as help those who are new get over hurdles.

You can sign up for the Commitmas #vBrownBag episodes at <a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/4522811764229913858" target="_blank">https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/4522811764229913858</a>

Hope to see you there!
