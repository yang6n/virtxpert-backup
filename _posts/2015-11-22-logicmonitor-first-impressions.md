<em>TL;DR - Sorry for the disappointing post, I was really hoping to finally get some hands on with LogicMonitor tonight, it appears though they do not have a great understanding of "Software as a Service" as their signup simply generates an automated email from sales and no access out of the gate.</em>

Before I get to LogicMonitor, allow me to wonder aloud for a moment why monitoring products are so horrible... I've been a long time Nagios user, and...it is what it is. How its not evolved beyond archaic config files is beyond me. How new tools like Sensu seem to be just as convoluted as Nagios was/is, is also beyond me. With that, I am hoping that some SaaS based solutions are a bit more modern for users to deal with - I don't want to make a career of learning how to write checks, alerts, and other modules - it's 2015 - this should work by now.

LogicMonitor has been on my radar for a while now, and I often run into them at VMUGs and VMworld. My one complaint with them, they don't publish their pricing, this is generally a huge red flag for me. There is also no free tier beyond the 14 day trial, I'm not going to layout any amount of money after 14 days, it is simply not long enough to have a good gauge of a monitoring tools effectiveness. But, alas, this also "is what it is". You can <a href="http://www.logicmonitor.com/signup/" target="_blank">sign up for a 14 day trial with no credit card</a>, so that is good at least.

Once you sign up... you get an email, stating someone is going to contact you...man - what a disappointment. I hope the folks at LogicMonitor are reading this, this is not how to attract customers.

Off to test DataDog it looks like.

Update: At least I get the automated email quickly, however it shouldn't take 30 minutes to add a "test instance"
