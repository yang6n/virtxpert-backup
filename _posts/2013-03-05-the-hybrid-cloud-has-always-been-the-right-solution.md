Recently, VMware made a lot of headlines, at least on Twitter, about their comment at Partner Exchange (PEX) stating:
<blockquote>"We all lose if they end up in these commodity public clouds"</blockquote>
But the reality is, a hybrid cloud model - leveraging both <del>internal</del> private infrastructure and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers such as AWS, Azure, ProfitBricks or vCloud partners has always been the right approach.  You may have noticed I changed my previous statement from "internal" to "private," the reason being is that you can manage a private infrastructure with an external service provider that isn't true "cloud" or "pay-as-you-go" with co-location vendors such as Xand or Savvis and even managed hosting providers such as Softlayer.

Your business needs some static infrastructure for authentication and security, and possibly other services because at some point you will out grow Google Apps or Office 365 for email or even Box or Syncplicity for file sharing.  The other reason I believe  you need this hybrid model is that placing all of infrastructure with one provider is just a bad practice in today's world.  While some providers offer different "zones" or different data centers to deploy in, there is still to much out of both your and your IaaS providers control and we have certainly seen outages from AWS and Azure that have gone on for extended periods of time.  Even services such as CloudFlare (a Content Delivery Network or CDN) which could mitigate or allow an easy transition to another location have not been without outages; taking this blog down for a short period of time.

James Statten from Forrester recently came down on VMware for their attacks on private cloud providers in his article - "<a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/james_staten/13-02-28-the_vmware_community_has_the_innovators_dilemma" target="_blank">The VMware Community has the innovators dilemma</a>" and quite honestly, for as much as I love what VMware has built, I think he is somewhat right.  While I may not totally agree with the title, the content of the article is certainly spot on.  VMware, in my opinion is still simply the best <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor" target="_blank">hypervisor</a> available bar none but their efforts to completely own the entire eco-system I think is a bit "Microsoft."  VMware you just cannot make the best "everything" - just look at Microsoft, Windows 8 is a joke, they are seemingly putting all their resources into fighting a consumer battle with Apple rather than just accepting they are really awesome at certain things.   You don't have to be really awesome at everything!  What I would love to see VMware do, rather than try and force hosting providers and IaaS providers to run vCloud director for interoperability is build functionality in so that I can move or extend my private workloads though vCloud director into public providers such as AWS, Azure or ProfitBricks.  Let Amazon worry about metal, power and cooling - give me a way to leverage resources that others are doing a good job with and you will still win.  You win by being able to focus your efforts in areas that matter and that you are good.  Keep your focus on virtualization, management and End User Computing (EUC) mobility with Horizon.

Please VMware, don't go all Microsoft and lose focus trying to beat everyone else at their own game.  And Microsoft, there is a lesson here for you as well - you don't have to be the best at everything.  Partner with VMware, we all still need to run Windows, Exchange, SQL, and SharePoint.  VMware, and even Citrix have the remote app thing pretty much down - let them focus on that and just give me a version of Windows that doesn't suck.
