News of the new VCP5-DCV delta exam (VCP550D) was bitter sweet for me.  Not minutes before the announcement I decided it couldn't push back my VCAP-DCA any longer or risk needing to re-take the VCP exam to remain certified for 2 more years...now I have another excuse not to dive in.  However, after carefully reviewing the blueprint published at <a href="https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=51919&amp;ui=www_cert" target="_blank">https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=51919&amp;ui=www_cert</a> I found that they blueprints are almost idential - I actually had to look several times to make sure I wasn't looking at the wrong blueprint!

So, what's new?
<ul>
	<li>Objective 3.3 – Configure and Administer Software Defined Storage:  This objective is focused entirely on VSAN</li>
</ul>
Yup...that's it - one new section in the blueprint.  This feels a bit more like a new version of the 5.5 VCP, time will tell once I take the "delta" exam.  Of course this exam is intended for differences between 5.0 and 5.5 yet is still 65 questions.  Curious if anyone has already taken the plunge?
