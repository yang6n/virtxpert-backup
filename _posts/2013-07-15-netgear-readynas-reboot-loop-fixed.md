A while back I had written a post about <a href="http://www.virtxpert.com/readynas-reboot-loop/" target="_blank">Netgear ReadyNAS units being stuck in a reboot loop</a>,  time got away from me on this one and I never posted the follow up but thanks to the power of the Interwebs and Googles someone found the post looking for the fix.  I edited out most of the fluff/troubleshoot and just kept the specifics on what was done to fix our unit.  Please note this is unsupported by Netgear and I am not responsible for any data loss or corrupt ReadyNAS units.  I hope this helps if you run into this problem, though it was apparently solved in a more recent firmware.
