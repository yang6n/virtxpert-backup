The 2014 vExpert application process is now open.  TL;DR head over to <strong><a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2014/02/vexpert-2014-applications-open.html" target="_blank">http://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2014/02/vexpert-2014-applications-open.html</a> </strong>to submit your application.

New, this year, is that nominations will be rolling all year, a nice chance for folks who didn't make the first cut to get in later on in the year.  2013 vExperts will also have a streamlined application; nice touch!

You have until March 6th to get your application in so don't delay...well I guess now you can since the applications are rolling :)
