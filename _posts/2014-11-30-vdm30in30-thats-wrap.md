Thank you to everyone for following along on my #vDM30in30 challenge and thank you to Melissa Palmer for making it a thing and to everyone who participated.  This was a great experience, while I am not likely to maintain a blog post per day pace going forward it did help me hone my skills and am very grateful for the experience.  If nothing else, it helped me learn a ton, and I came out the other side a bit smarter than I was on October 31st.

I would also like to thank everyone who sent over positive feedback on my posts.  As many are, I am my harshest critic I was worried that I wasn't producing something useful for people.  When people who I consider much smarter than me started messaging me telling me they liked the posts I knew I was on the right track.

So, here it is - last post, on the last day of November, in the last minute of the month!
