The participants, including myself, just wrapped up the first <a href="http://www.virtualdesignmaster.com/" target="_blank">Virtual Design Master</a> Challenge; <a href="http://www.virtualdesignmaster.com/the-challenges/" target="_blank">a detailed virtualization design</a> that was designed to test our skills in thinking through business and technical requirements and then write up that design.  First and foremost, I drastically under estimated the level of effort just to get what was in my brain down on paper, I spent a solid 4-6 hours writing/re-thinking/re-writing/second-guess my re-writing until finally I was not only out of time, my brain was pretty much mush.  Now I don't want you to think I am comparing what we are doing here to writing a design for your VCDX, not at all suggesting I am on that level (yet), but  doing this has <del>elevated</del> skyrocketed my respect and appreciation for effort put forth by anyone who has ever even attempted a written VCDX level design.

I signed up for the Virtual Design Master competition for a learning experience and to push my skills and it certainly delivered on the very first challenge.  If your not following along yet on Twitter, you can follow <a href="http://twitter/vdmchallenge" target="_blank">@vDMChallenge</a> and don't forget to visit the competition sponsors; <a href="http://www.virtualdesignmaster.com/sponsors/" target="_blank">BareMetal Cloud; TrainSignal and RadicalIO</a>
