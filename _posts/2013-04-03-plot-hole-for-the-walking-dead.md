Totally random thought that won't fit in 140 characters... In most zombie movies, you get bit or scratched and you get infected and turn into a zombie. In season 2 we found out everyone is infected, you die you turn into a zombie. So why then, when Hershel was bit in the leg, did they need to amputate to prevent the infection from spreading? He, in theory, was already infected and a non-life threatening bite should not be cause for amputation.
