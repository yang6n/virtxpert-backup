tl;dr version:  Save the $35, its not ready for everyday use or on large screen devices.

A few quick notes to consider before you get started. Consider how your audio is played.  For example I run all my video and audio through a receiver, so while I was able to get video after setting up my Chromecast directly on a TV input I couldn't get audio. When I connected the Chromecast directly to the receiver it worked properly. However, that means I couldnt power via USB since I have no USB on the receiver, so I need to find an outlet for the power adapter.

The setup wizard was straight forward.
<ul>
	<li>Connect your Chromcast to an available HDMI port and either USB port on the TV or power outlet</li>
	<li>Turn on the TV and change to the input assoicated with the HDMI port you connected the Chromecast to</li>
	<li>You should see a message similar to "Set me up"</li>
	<li>Go to google.com/chromecast/setup</li>
	<li>Download the Chromecast app, copy to the install folder and run the app</li>
	<li>Accept the license agreement</li>
	<li>The app will find your Chromecast, click continue</li>
	<li>Verify the code in the Chromecast app matches what is displayed on your TV and click Thats my code</li>
	<li>Select your wifi network and enter your wifi key/password and optionally, change the name of your Chromecast device and click continue</li>
	<li>The message on your TV should be similar to to the Chromecast app - connecting to wifi, then downloading updates if necessary</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Once the updates are complete, the Chromecast device will restart and apply the updates</li>
	<li>Click continue on the Chromecast app</li>
	<li>Click on Get Cast Extension which is a browser plugin to stream from Chrome to your Chromecast device</li>
	<li>A new Chrome window will open, click on Add Extension, click Add</li>
	<li>Click the Cast icon in your browser and select your device</li>
	<li>You can now see your browser screen from your computer on your TV (less navigation bars)</li>
</ul>
Notes

<strong>via OSX Mavericks with Chrome</strong>

Cons
<ul>
	<li>There is enough of a lag from the video playback to give you a headache. This could be either
<ul>
	<li>A) 802.11G not being fast enough</li>
	<li>B) TV refresh rate being to slow (60Hz)</li>
	<li>C) Video quality from the web being to low for a 52" TV (YouTube/AMC.com Walking Dead Webisode, the lag seemed consistent also on NBC.com)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>If you are not using Chrome, you will have to, there seems to be no support for other browsers</li>
	<li>Cannot watch Amazon prime videos in full screen mode</li>
</ul>
<strong>via an iPad (and assume iPhone)</strong>

Pros
<ul>
	<li>Notifications do not seem to interfere with video/audio playback.</li>
</ul>
Cons
<ul>
	<li>Can only seem to stream from Youtube or Netflix, the Chrome browser in iOS does not appear to be aware of the Cast app.</li>
</ul>
<strong>via Windows Phone 8</strong>
No support for WP8, this may end my WP8 experiment before it even really got started

<strong>Summary</strong>
Its a $35 device, and that is about on par with the quality I might expect from a $35 video device. Hopefully the Chromecast isn't a one and done type of device as I think it could be useful with more device and website support.  I will look at testing this more with an Android device, maybe its a bit better working with the Google ecosystem or as a travel companion, however for now I'll stick to streaming through my Blu-Ray player and internet enabled TV.  Take the $35 and put that towards a night out or towards a Roku.
