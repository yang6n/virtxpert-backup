I am a huge fan of Jive and have also been keeping an eye on several up and coming web conferencing / meeting services - one of which was Meetings.io.  Meetings.io announced yesterday that they were acquired by Jive - now two of my favorite products will become one.  I was glad to read that Meetings.io will continue to be developed and supported as not everyone I work with is a Jive customer, but also look forward to the Meetings.io technology being integrated into Jive (Google+ Hangout type feature?) to make that platform even more collaborative in the Enterprise Social space.

Another interesting use case this expands for Jive is as a learning environment, rather than a traditional LMS you can now use (you can read more about Jive for an LMS here an <a href="https://community.jivesoftware.com/docs/DOC-61859">https://community.jivesoftware.com/docs/DOC-61859</a>)
