A new Fling was recently released called Visual Esxtop, I won't get into specifics on <a href="http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-9279" target="_blank">Esxtop </a>(command line version) in this post, just a quick run and first thoughts.  You can download Visual Esxtop from labs.vmware.com or by clicking <a href="http://labs.vmware.com/flings/visualesxtop" target="_blank">here</a>.  Once downloaded, extract the file and run visualEsxtop.bat which launches a Java program.  Click on File, then Connect to Live Server.

Enter the name or IP address of your ESXi host, username and password and click the connect button.  You will now be able to view stats on your ESXi host just you were connected to the command line but be able to sort data by doing things we are accustomed to in say Excel by clicking column headers.  Certainly a very nice Fling that I will be keeping on my USB drive!
