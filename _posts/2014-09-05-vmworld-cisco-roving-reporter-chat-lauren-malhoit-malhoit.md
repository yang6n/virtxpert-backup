While running about at VMworld from the community hang space supporting the #vBrownBag and checking out EMC sessions and talks I had the honor of being asked to chat with Lauren Malhoit about the conference - this years Cisco Roving Reporter.  For those that haven't seen them before, they are quick talks - just a few minutes long.  We chatted a bit about VMware:EVO and the #vBrownBag podcast.  You can check out mine below:
