Starting on on May 12th I will be working at EMC in the Education Services group.  A long time ago someone told me to know what my priorities are in life and I'd rarely have to make a difficult decision, well for me that is family, friends, health, education and work so to combine two of those into my job was something I could not pass up.  I'll remain very hands on in this role which is also very exciting for me.  I will still be blogging here (though I know I've been quiet recently as I work through the transition in my current role) and be on the various social networks as I am today (I am who I am, not defined by my employer) as well as supporting the <a href="http://professionalvmware.com" target="_blank">#vBrownBag</a>.

Back to wrapping up projects!
