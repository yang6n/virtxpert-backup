<a href="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/symantec.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2399" src="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/symantec-300x300.png" alt="symantec" width="300" height="300" /></a>If you are a Symantec customer and want to expand you knowledge of your products and their other available products, you can now access their eLearning library known "Symantec's eLibrary for free by registering at as <a href="http://techcenter.symantec.com/ecampus/enterprise" target="_blank">http://techcenter.symantec.com/ecampus/enterprise</a> which was previously $1400 per user.  This is a nice step by Symantec and follows what many in the industry such as VMware and EMC do with many of their eLearning titles.

Symantec for me used to be my go to for years for anti-malware and backup, however Backup Exec fell on some hard times in my opinion circa 2008-2010 and made me look for alternatives.  Whether or not they have been able to make up ground to the likes of Unitrends with UEB and UVB and Veeam remains to be seen.  This step, however, is a good opportunity to train current and potential new customers on how to properly use their products and avoid frustrated customers like I was and jumped the fence to greener pastures.
