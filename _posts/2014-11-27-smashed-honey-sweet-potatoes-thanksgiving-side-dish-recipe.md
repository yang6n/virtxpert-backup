My cousin is hosting Thanksgiving this year, so I don't have to cook turkey but was asked to bring a side dish - Smashed Honey Sweet Potatoes .  What you'll need (to feed roughly 6-8 people or so):
<ul>
	<li>5 medium+ sweet potatoes</li>
	<li>4 bananas</li>
	<li>Honey</li>
	<li>Brown sugar</li>
	<li>Cranberry granola mix</li>
	<li>Olive oil</li>
</ul>
Pre-heat the oven to 400-deg; while the oven is pre-heating microwave two of the sweet potatoes until they are very soft (repeat until all 5 or mushy).  When the oven gets to 400-deg place the 4 bananas in the oven in the peel and let cook for about 10-12 minutes.

While the banans are cooking, scoop out the sweet potato from the skin and place into a large oven save bowl you can put back in the oven.  I started with masher to get the sweet potatoes to the consistency I wanted, but because they are so thick I ended used a knife to whip the sweet potatoes in the bowl - the also wisk kept getting "clogged."  With the sweet potatoes whipped, remove the bananas from the oven, they should be very soft, almost melted; add them to the sweet potatoes and whip again until you cannot see the bananas.

Add 1/2 to 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar and 1/2 to 2 cups of honey depending on how sweet you like it.  I started with honey and if the honey taste was too strong, I added a little more brown sugar.  Mix well.

Place 2-3 cups (or more if you really like the mix) in a separate bowl and lightly coat with olive oil.  Now sprinkle in brown sugar and mix together by hand.  Crumble the mix over the sweet potatoes and bananas and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or so.  The result..
