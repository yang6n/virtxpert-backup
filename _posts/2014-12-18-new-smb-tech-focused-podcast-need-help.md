Howdy everyone. Â A conversation on Twitter popped up the other day before I took the year off (clearly I'm doing well at that) about starting a podcast focused on the SMB space. To help put that together, I was hoping you would take a few seconds to answer this short 10 question survey so we can get an idea of where the SMB is today.

Thank you to everyone who has responded so far, and thank you for for all those taking the time now!
