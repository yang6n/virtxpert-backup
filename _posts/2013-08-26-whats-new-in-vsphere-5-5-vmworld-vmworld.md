For those at, or watching via the web the keynote from VMworld, a new version of ESXi / vSphere 5.5 was announced.  As you would expect in a "major point release", it is composed of mostly improvements rather than new features many of which doubled existing config maximums including:
<ul>
	<li>Full OSX Web Client Support</li>
	<li>New Virtual Machine Version 10 which supports more virtual disks (up from 60 to 120 - 2x)</li>
	<li>A winder range of GPU's for View deployments including Linux support</li>
	<li>Improved SSO config for authentication services with MS SQL</li>
	<li>Improved vCenter appliance now able to support up to 500 hosts or 5000 VMs</li>
	<li>Improved HA application monitoring via Hyperic</li>
	<li>Support for 62TB data stores</li>
	<li>16Gbps FC support, end to end</li>
	<li>Flash Read Cache (rut roh Pernix?)</li>
</ul>
I am certainly excited about the continued improvements and look forward to getting this into the lab.  Also announced today is vSAN - a virtual SAN appliance from VMware.  I dont yet see an officially published vSphere 5.5 config maximums guide but you can find the list of new features for vSphere 5.5 at <a href="http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/vsphere/VMware-vSphere-Platform-Whats-New.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/vsphere/VMware-vSphere-Platform-Whats-New.pdf</a>
