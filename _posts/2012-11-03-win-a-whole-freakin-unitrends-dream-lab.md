Unitrends is running a contest where you can win 2 HP servers, a Netgear ReadyNAS, HP switch and Microsoft, VMware and Unitrends licenses.  All you have to do is download their backup appliance by February 14th from www.unitrends.com/win-dream-lab/?src=jonathanfrappier.wordpress.com

Plays well into my plans to review different backup solutions!
