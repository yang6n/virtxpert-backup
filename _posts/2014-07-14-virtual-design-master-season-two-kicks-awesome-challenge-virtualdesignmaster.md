Docker? Cobbler? Ansible?  I'm really excited to see!!

Being a participant last year was an amazing experience, one that I feel helped me not only become a better infrastructure designer, but also helped me understand what really goes into a good design - I have  new level of appreciation for the amount of time producing a high quality document takes (hint its not quick!).
