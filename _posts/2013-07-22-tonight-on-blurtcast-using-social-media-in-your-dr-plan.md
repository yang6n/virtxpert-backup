I will be presenting tonight on <a href="http://www.nerdblurt.com/blurtcast" target="_blank">#BlurtCast</a> about how you can leverage social media outlets such as Twitter, Facebook or Google+ in your disaster recovery (dr) plan.  As part of the presentation I will be discussing stats and lessons learned during a hurricane last summer where we leveraged social media for a basic communication channel with a very "non-social" employee base (i.e. very few (less than 5) employees had an existing Twitter account out of 200).
