So...umm...yea talk about it they say...  I get anxiety attacks.  There I said it.  It hasn't always happened, actually it started quite recently.  Given my CDO (OCD in alphabetical order) and general troubleshooting background I can tell when it first happened (May 2014 during a meeting).  Not too many people know, well now you all do and that is okay since I want it to be in the open to see if that gets whatever fear/thought etc...triggering it out of the way.  Symptoms range from general nervousness, sweating, increased heart rate to things I'd rather not talk about (but they suck).

The first reaction, as is the case in many instances, was treated not as anxiety problems but general medical conditions.  A few rounds of antibiotics, drugs, blood tests etc all that showed nothing was physically wrong (so that's good!).  If you saw me at VMworld this past week, I was generally always having at least a slight/minor episode/attack whatever you call it.  I'm able to mostly keep it at the tolerable levels.  Thankfully, only twice was it really bad - once I just left and went back to my apartment took a shower and kind of reset mentally and the second time Larry Smith happened to walk over and had a great conversation that took my mind from where ever it was to a different place where I felt more comfortable (I've not entirely pinned down where either of those two places are yet).

So what do you do when you get anxiety attacks?  For me a couple of things helped.  First I can just hyper focus on something - adding random numbers on signs, deep conversation (seemingly 1 on 1 is best) or removing myself from the situation.  The later is obviously not the preferred option.  I had a pretty good one the last night at vBeers, went outside the bar for a bit and chatted and got comfortable again to go back in.  If you have anxiety attacks and haven't figured out how to get past it, give those a try.  I've not entirely pinned down the scenario in which it happens.  Sometimes it's in large groups of people (VMworld) and sometimes it's not (beach).  Some times it is indoors (meeting, conference etc...) and sometimes not (friends' cookout).  With people I know, and with people I don't know.  With people who rank above me (professionally) and those that do not.  Understanding exactly when it will happen is not quite a science, which can make it hard to know it's coming, which probably adds to the anxiety.

So, brain, now the world knows so cut the s**t and get back to geeking out.
