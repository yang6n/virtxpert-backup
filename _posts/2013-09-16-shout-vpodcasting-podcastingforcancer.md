If you were on the Twitters this weekend, you got to witness quite an amazing act of kindness, generosity and community support from the various VMware enthusiast.  The background on the story started with some sad news from <a href="https://twitter.com/Bacon_Is_King" target="_blank">Gabriel Chapman</a>, who lost his father last year to cancer, and now is mother is also fighting cancer.  <a href="http://www.trevorpott.com/?p=504" target="_blank">Trevor Pott, with the support of Jon Harris came up with an idea to raise money, with the hope of showing his friend he is not alone</a> (Trevor's Twitter account is <a href="https://twitter.com/cakeis_not_alie" target="_blank">here</a>, Jon's <a href="https://twitter.com/ThevCACGuy" target="_blank">here</a>).  The community rallied behind #PodCastingforCancer, with the donations going to the American Cancer Society.  In less than 24 hours, the community raised over $2500 and the fund raising continued Sunday where, before we hit lunch on the east coast the fund broke $4200 (there is a check in the mail directly, plus what is on the site).

I am glad to have been able to donate, and was happy to see vendors like <a href="http://www.zerto.com/simple-automated-disaster-recovery-new/?zsource=Blogad&amp;zdesc=Virtxpert&amp;zadid=Simple&amp;zasset=HBRWP&amp;zcid=701F0000000Wx7O" target="_blank">Zerto</a> get involved and make a donation.  If you are interested in donating, head over to <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/podcasting-for-cancer">http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/podcasting-for-cancer</a> and make a donation - everything counts.

I have been fortunate in my life with regards to cancer, while I lost my great grand father to cancer - I was lucky enough to have known him for over 21 years, and while my grandfather is currently terminal with colon cancer I also had the benefit of a long relationship with him (35+ years).  My good fortune in this regard thankfully carried over to my wife's family, my mother-in-law has survived breast cancer and been clear of it for several years.  My donation not only goes out in memory of them, but to friends who were not as lucky as I such as one of my best friends Jeremy L. who I have known for over 15 years now, he lost his mother to cancer last year and my thoughts and prayers are with some new friends as their mother is currently battling cancer.

Thank you to everyone who has donated so far - please consider a donation or, if you are unable to donate financially, why not consider presenting on one of the podcast?  If you are interested in presenting please leave a comment and I will make an introduction.
