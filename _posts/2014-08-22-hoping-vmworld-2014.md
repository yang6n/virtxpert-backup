<em>**Disclaimer - I am an EMC employee, however I have no insight into future VMware products or features, beyond what is announced by VMware**</em>

I am looking forward to my first VMworld next week, here are a few things I am hoping for more information on:
<ul>
	<li>Evo/Evo Rails (formerly known as Marvin):  Marvin is rumored to be a hyper-converged infrastructure appliance - this would be a new path for VMware as it has been strictly a software company.  You can read some rumors on Evo from <a href="http://vninja.net/vmware-2/evolution-baby/" target="_blank">Christian Mohn at vNinja.net </a>and <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/08/20/vmware_seeks_two_new_hardwarerelated_trademarks/" target="_blank">The Register</a>.</li>
	<li>Updates on vCloud Air (formerly vCloud Hybrid Service):  vCloud Air is VMware's IaaS/cloud offering.  In my opinion it operates at a level above commodity IaaS providers such as AWS but up until now you have had to sign up for a contract/commitment.  When vCHS was in beta, there was  pay as you go model - hopefully this is coming back.  The <a href="http://ir.vmware.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=867208" target="_blank">official VMware Press Release can be found here</a> as well as <a href="http://www.discoposse.com/index.php/2014/08/21/vcloud-air-whats-in-a-name-a-lot-really/" target="_blank">Eric Wright's take over at his blog discoposse.com</a>.</li>
	<li>Deep dives in CloudVolumes:  On August 20th, <a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/euc/2014/08/cloudvolumes.html" target="_blank">VMware announced the acquired CloudVolumes</a> - a company that seems to simplify application deployment by abastracticing the application from the OS.  Most of the buzz seemed to be from EUC folks (See <a href="http://cto.vmware.com/welcoming-new-member-vmware-family-cloudvolumes/" target="_blank">Kit Colbert's post here</a>).  CloudVolumes also as a <a href="http://cloudvolumes.com/products/server-workloads/" target="_blank">solution for server workloads as well</a> - will this become VMware's answer to the container craze (e.g. Docker)?</li>
	<li>Continued advancements for all things vSphere:  While its hard to imagine what "new" features could be added to vSphere at this point (we all know about <a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2012/10/virtual-volumes-vvols-tech-preview-with-video.html" target="_blank">vVOLs by now</a>), another year of advances in expanding configuration maximums would certainly be welcome.  I for one would love to see an increase in cluster sizes so that I can build larger VSAN clusters and not be limited to 32 nodes.  I'd also like to see continued improvements in their appliance based solutions and a VMware Update Manager appliance.  Though if anyone from VMware is reading this, please for the love of all technology make <a href="http://www.virtualdesignmaster.com/congrats-to-vwilmo-for-winning-the-fictional-vsphere-5-5-5-flash-virtualdesignmaster-challenge/" target="_blank">Geoff Whilmington's scale out VCSA become a thing</a>!  No SPOF!</li>
	<li>Community:  What I am probably looking forward to the most is getting to meet so many of the people I've had the pleasure of virtually meeting though blogs, twitter and other online social events.  I've been able to do it a bit piece meal, getting to meet folks like Cody Bunch, Damian Karlson and Jon Harris but there are so many people I have yet to meet like Trevor Pott, Larry Smith Jr and Alastair Cooke (not to mention so many more).</li>
</ul>
If you are going to be at VMworld, you'll likely find me in the community space with the #vBrownBag crew as well as at <a href="http://blog.vmunderground.com/events/11549762651/" target="_blank">OpenActs </a>and the <a href="http://blog.vmunderground.com/events/12379753175/" target="_blank">VMunderground</a>.  See you on Sunday!
