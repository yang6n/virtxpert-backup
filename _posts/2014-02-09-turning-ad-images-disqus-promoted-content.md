I recently received a notification that Disqus has added a new <del>great</del> way to <del>spam my readers</del> serve ads using images.  While for some sites this is nice, its not for me and I really only use Disqus for comments.  In the notification email it stated that you could return to text based ads anytime, however it wasn't clear when logging into Disqus how this was actually done so...
<ul>
	<li>Log into www.disqus.com</li>
	<li>Click your user profile/icon on the top right and select admin</li>
	<li>Click on the Settings tab, then the Ads sub-tab</li>
	<li>Uncheck Use Thumbnails</li>
	<li>Click Save Changes</li>
</ul>
It seems pretty obvious here, however the email suggested it would be turning on "text-only ads" and there was no option called "text-only ads."
