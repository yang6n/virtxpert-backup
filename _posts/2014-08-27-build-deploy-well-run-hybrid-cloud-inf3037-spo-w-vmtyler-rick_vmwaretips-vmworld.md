Notes from the How to Build and Deploy a Well Run Hybrid Cloud #INF3037-SPO session at VMworld: IT has to transform into a service broker (or as I have always thought of it, IT is a service provider).  By working with the business IT should be able to provide the services needed to its users, whether its providing internal/local resources or public - IT can/should be the broker to those resources. <a href="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/EMC-ehc-business-reqs.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2522 size-full" src="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/EMC-ehc-business-reqs.png" alt="emc-hybrid-cloud-reasons" width="1187" height="428" /></a> Why hybrid?  That is what businesses want; enterprise apps are still being deployed privately - security, control, and licensing are some common reasons.  Building a hybrid cloud allows IT and the business to leverage either resource as needed allowing IT to operate as a service provider (ITaaS) <a href="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/EMC-ehc-pub-priv.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2524" src="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/EMC-ehc-pub-priv.png" alt="EMC-ehc-pub-priv" width="915" height="333" /></a>

By enabling ITaaS with EMC Hybrid Cloud for VMware, businesses can expect

<!--more-->

To reduce their budget by saving on external services that business units or departments may be using as "shadow IT" services that is outside the control of the IT group.  ITaaS also enables IT to spend more time working on innovation, rather than maintenance by enabling self service and real time access to resources by the user.

How does an IT organization transform?  First, by providing standardized services, IT as a service consolidates IT resources across the enterprise and provides cost-effective IT applications and infrastructure.  Forward-thinking IT organizations are taking this further and providing their business consumers with a choice of internal and external services, and so become brokers of IT services to the business.  IT as a Service also delivers more agility and transparency than traditional IT by providing clear pricing and published service levels for IT services, which can be directly delivered to business consumers through a self-provisioning portal that ties into automated deployment of IT processes.  As you can see below, automation is a key tenant of a well run hybrid cloud (but also a well run IT organization - <a title="The 5 most important factors in IT – security shouldn’t be one of them" href="http://www.virtxpert.com/the-5-most-important-factors-in-it-security-shouldnt-be-one-of-them/">see my previous post here</a> - <a title="The 5 most important factors in IT – security shouldn’t be one of them" href="http://www.virtxpert.com/the-5-most-important-factors-in-it-security-shouldnt-be-one-of-them/">The 5 most important factors in IT</a>)

At the Cloud management layer, vCenter Orchestrator connects the virtual environment with the elements of the software defined data center…enabling integration and functionality across the compute, networking, and storage components.  VCO also opens the doors to integration outside of the private cloud.  Integration across the data center is possible with VCO’s extensible set of scripts, api’s, and ecosystem of connectors. EMC ViPR connects your physical storage into the private cloud, with storage automation and orchestration that enables you to add storage to your private cloud through the vCAC self-service portal.

One of the challenge of a hybrid cloud is deployment time and how soon the benefits of the cloud will be seen by lines of business. In traditional cloud deployments, IT does the deployment internally through a fully custom integration. The argument has traditionally been that custom is necessary to meet all needs of the business and IT, this is no longer true. Why is there such a time difference?

<a href="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/EMC-ehc-deploy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2534" src="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/EMC-ehc-deploy.jpg" alt="EMC-ehc-deploy" width="952" height="493" /></a>

EMC has developed a more standardized approach based on predefined architectures will speed adoption and will help meet business requirements without lengthy custom engagements. This predefined solution stack is optimized for cloud and virtualization and decreases the software integration and configuration time.  In the Planning phase, EMC will help you determine the exact solution for your needs.  Speaking of needs, here are some questions you should consider when planning a hybrid cloud deployment:
