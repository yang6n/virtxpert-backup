VMware View Bootcamp Mobile Secure Desktop - Day 1

Overview
- Load balancing, vShield, AD, CA, Radius, View Considerations

Fully validated configuration, meant as a base to be updated to work for your needs.
- End user devices
- Connect via internal (trusted) or external networks (untrusted)
- L7 LB between networks
- Security servers send traffic to Connection Managers
- Infrastucture Services (AD DCs, DNS, SSO, CA, Radius, F&amp;P, Backup)
- vCenter, vShield, AV, VC Ops Manager
- VMware View desktop pools

Provide Mobility for VD session, Security, User Experience

<!--more-->

Items to consider
- IP Schema, VLANs, routing and DNS
- AD topology (child domains? new forest?)
- Security requirments and policies
- Application workload (what are the apps), ThinApp/AppV/XenApp or installed into image
- WAN/LAN QoS for real time/high speed access
- Compliance requirments

Load Balancing and namespace services (cap2)

vSheild - security zone around vm pools, apps, infrastructure
- Define rules in advance as part of scoping/documentation
- Remember rules for view agent/client/server communications and display
- Generate support logs from vSheild

vShield Endpoint
- AV/Malware at hypervisor level per VM host
- Tune AV strategy

Active Directory considerations
- Eval existing AD
- New domain?
- Enough resources in a site?
- Configure sites and subnets for DC/replication
- Enterprise CA needs to be configured in Forest Root Domain

Radius
- 2 Factor
- Plan for extra conection servers with redundancy
- Validated design uses MS Radius

Persona Management
- Roam user data/settings
- VMs for hosting profiles
- Use persona or roaming profiles - not both
- Folder redirection
- App specific requirments such as ThinApp
- AV strategy using persona - scanning of vSheild Endpoint

vSphere and View considerations
- Using vDS (virtual distributed switch)
- Auto-Deploy and host profiles
- DHCP and load balancing

Connection broker tagging feature in VMware View

Leverage vApps
