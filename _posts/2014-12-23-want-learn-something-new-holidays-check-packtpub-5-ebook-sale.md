Looking to learn something new during the holidays? Maybe its slow at work and you've wondered what this whole<a href="https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/vmware-vsphere-resource-management-essentials" target="_blank"> VMware thing is</a>, or you are taking part in Commitmas and want a <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/all/?search=git" target="_blank">reference for Git,</a> maybe some other things like <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/all/?search=ansible" target="_blank">Ansible</a> have peaked your interest? Packt Publishing has you covered; they are <a href="http://bit.ly/1wlsbea" target="_blank">running a $5 eBook sale</a> (<a href="http://bit.ly/1wlsbea" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1wlsbea</a>).

Packt, of course, is the publisher of my book but this $5 eBook sale is just in time for me as I am taking part in Commitmas and would like to broaden my knowledge on Git, Vagrant and Ansible - not a bad set of reading for $15!
