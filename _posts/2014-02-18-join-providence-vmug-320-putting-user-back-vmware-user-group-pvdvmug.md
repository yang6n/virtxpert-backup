Well, I've managed to get away with not presenting at all, even though I've often hosted podcasts such as the #vBrownBrag, for quite a while now (rumor has it I did a session on #BlurtCast but since Luigi never posted it, its all just internet rumor:).  It's about time I ante up and present and present  (I blame Scott Lowe - <a href="http://blog.scottlowe.org/2013/09/18/putting-the-user-back-in-vmware-user-group/">http://blog.scottlowe.org/2013/09/18/putting-the-user-back-in-vmware-user-group/</a>); I'll be at the <a href="http://www.vmug.com/e/in/eid=1239" target="_blank">Providence VMUG on March 20th</a> talking about community and server side caching.  If you are in the Rhode Island area come by and meet other local virtualization professionals.
