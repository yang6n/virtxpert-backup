Well I did it, I scheduled my VCAP-DCD for Tuesday February 26th. Â I have a lot I want to cover between now and then and here is what I will be doing.
<ul>
	<li>APAC <a href="http://professionalvmware.com/brownbags/" target="_blank">#vBrownBag</a> VCAP-DCD recordings (done but will likely listen to them a few more times)</li>
	<li>Clustering Deep Dive (about half way done)</li>
	<li>VMware Press books - storage and building a vDC</li>
	<li>Mastering vSphere 5 (re-read)</li>
	<li>DR/BCP course from VMware available on MyLearn</li>
</ul>
That doesn't seem like nearly enough as I write it out.
