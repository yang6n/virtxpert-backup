Some consumer tech reviews over the weekend for you! During the last 6 months I have been looking for alternatives to the common carrier Android devices. While not all of these devices are bad, say for example the Samsung Galaxy S or Edge devices, but in my mind they are not worth the $200-$300 to be locked into a contract for 2 years. There are unlocked phone options such as the One Plus series of phones as well as the Google Nexus phones, but you will easily be at $300 or more.

Enter BLU Android Phones; BLU Products produces several different phones of varying sizes, specs and colors. I now own 3 different BLU Product phones and so far 2 have impressed, one has left me a bit disappointed.

The first phone I purchased was the <strong>BLU Studio 6.0 HD</strong>. This is a 6" Android device which has been upgraded by BLU to Android 5.0 (lollipop). The specs, while limited have proved more than capable of running Android and a "typical" set of applications such as Chrome, Gmail, Twitter, Waze, Kindle, MapMyRun, and other social apps. I don't do much in the way of games, so I don't have anything for you there.

The specs:
<ul>
	<li>6" IPS Display</li>
	<li>1.3GHz Quad-core MALI processor</li>
	<li>1GB RAM</li>
	<li>4GB or 8GB storage</li>
	<li>Dual SIM slots</li>
	<li>MicroSD slot up to 32GB</li>
	<li>4G HSPA up to 21Mbps</li>
</ul>
I was concerned at first by only having 1GB of RAM,  but without carrier bloatware, it proves to be just enough for every day tasks. The biggest drawback to the phone so far has been the constant dropping of the data network, this makes it very frustrating to use as i can never rely on having data without a reboot of the phone. The camera is also sub-par, fine outside, not so much inside. I was initially impressed by the Studio HD 6.0, before running into the data network problems (I swapped out the SIM to have the same results, and the same SIM works fine in a new phone I purcahsed).

After being initially impressed with the Studio HD 6.0, I purchased my wife - a long time iDevice user, the <strong>BLU VIVO Air</strong>. This phone is all about size, at only 5.1mm thick.

<a href="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/blu-vivo.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4214" src="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/blu-vivo.png" alt="blu-vivo" width="134" height="354" /></a>BLU did not try to cram to much into this phone, but it has proven to be very stable and with enough performance to keep my wife from going back to an iPhone. The specs:
<ul>
	<li>4.8" Super Amoled display</li>
	<li>1.7GHz Octo-core MALI processor</li>
	<li>1GB RAM</li>
	<li>16GB Storage</li>
	<li>Single SIM slot</li>
	<li>No MicroSD</li>
	<li>4G HSPA+</li>
</ul>
The camera, like the Studio HD 6 is a bit lacking indoors / lower light situations, but fine outdoors on a reasonably clear day. Speed, again, has not been a problem, even without true 4G speeds as my wife does a good amount of streaming audio - it has never been an issue for her on either Pandora or Spotify.

&nbsp;

While I was happy with the Studio HD 6.0, I did find a bit large to carry around, so when they released the new <strong>Life 8 XL</strong> at a discounted price I jumped on and picked one up (the Global GSM version). I'm not sure whether I have a defective unit, if the global GSM version is a problem, or if the Life 8 XL cut to many corners, but this phone has been disappointing. The specs of the phone are right on par with the previous two:
<ul>
	<li>5.5" HD display<a href="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/blu-8-xl.png"><img class="alignright wp-image-4215" src="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/blu-8-xl.png" alt="blu-8-xl" width="138" height="362" /></a></li>
	<li>1.4GHz Octa-core MediaTek processor</li>
	<li>1GB RAM</li>
	<li>8GB Storage</li>
	<li>Dual SIM slot</li>
	<li>MicroSD up to 64GB</li>
	<li>4G HSPA+</li>
</ul>
However, the screen has proven to be very disappointing. Not only is not often not responsive, it is downright unusable while plugged in - if you need to charge AND use the phone, forget about it (and yes this is with the factory provided charger). More often than not I find the phone to be extremely slugish even though CPU and memory utilization are with the range of the other devices; I'm not sure if its actually slow or the screen is again having problems. I reached out to BLU within a few days of having the phones when I realized there was a problem while charging and never heard back. Yet another draw back of the Life 8 XL is it has a horrible GPS, even in high accuracy mode it is often several streets away from where I am. Additionally, while it states the phone can be upgraded to Lollipop, BLU has yet to push this out to my device. After dealing with the charging issues for a few months, I finally switched back to the Studio 6 HD.

If you are looking for an inexpensive, yet functional off contract, unlocked, and bloatware free device, I can highly recommend the the BLU VIVO Air device, it has been very good for my wife so far. While I have not had good luck with the BLU Studio HD 6 or the Life 8 XL, YMMV (if you go with it and have better luck do let me know). There are other BLU phones that come with more RAM, but like the other unlocked phones, their prices are into the $250-$300 range, at that point I'd just buy a Nexus 5x (currently $299 at Amazon (as of Thanksgiving weekend).
