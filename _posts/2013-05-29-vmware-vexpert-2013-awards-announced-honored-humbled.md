And a little bit in shock, as I look through the <a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2013/05/vexpert-2013-awardees-announced.html" target="_blank">list of 2013 VMware vExperts</a> I can't help but be humbled, many of the people in this group have taught me a great many things, even if indirectly via blogs and social media or more directly with many published authors in the list.  When I decided to become more involved with the community, it was not for awards or recognition, but rather a way to learn, share and connect with others who are also passionate about technology, however this award feels quite amazing as it goes beyond just technical knowledge.

A huge thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/jtroyer" target="_blank">John Mark Troyer</a> and the VMware Social Media team, I look forward to continue my support of VMware and also push myself to new levels in 2013.
