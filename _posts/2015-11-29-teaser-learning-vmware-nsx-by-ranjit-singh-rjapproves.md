I have been fortuneate enough in my day job to get hands on experience with VMware NSX, even before the bits were available to download I was supporting NSX via the Federation Enterprise Hybrid Cloud, as it is one of the core components. For people still looking to get a jump start on learning NSX, I wanted to give you a bit of a teaser for an upcoming book by Ranjit Singh - Learning VMware NSX.

<a href="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/B05029_MockupCover_Normal__0.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4227 size-full" src="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/B05029_MockupCover_Normal__0.png" alt="B05029_MockupCover_Normal__0" width="302" height="373" /></a>

Since I am a technical reviewer for this book, which is being published by Packt Publishing, I can't give away to much but can tell you it is packed with step by step examples on how to get up and running quickly with NSX and understand the various components and how they interact. <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/learning-vmware-nsx" target="_blank">Keep an eye out on the Packt site</a>, and I expect you'll here more from me and @rjapproves when it is released!
