I let myself lose focus last week, here is the plan:

1.  Watch APAC #vBrownBag recordings
2.  Finish Clustering Deep Dive
3.  Watch DR training on MyLearn
4.  Watch SRM training on VMware.com
5.  Read Storage Implementation from VMware Press
6.  Take notes (from slides) from the VCAP-DCD and VCDX #vBrownbags
7.  Re-read 
8.  Review VCAP-DCD blueprint and study guides by Gregg Robertson (@GreggRobertson5) and Shane Williford (@coolsport00)

I also have a small startup looking for a basic office setup so I am going to "design" the hell out of it.
