Over the last 6 months or so I've had to spend more time with OpenStack that I had in my entire career combined. One thing I kept hearing was how complex OpenStack was/is, that there were to many components to keep track of. As I sat down to really think about that, especially as it relates to VMware I came up with this. Now not everything is a perfect 1-to-1 match, so please don't tear me up on Twitter/comments, but I think you'll get the point:

<a href="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/openstack-comp-vmware-programs.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4141" src="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/openstack-comp-vmware-programs.png" alt="openstack-comp-vmware-programs" width="1100" height="1200" /></a>

So, still think VMware is less complex? Or has less components? Now, certainly there are differences in deployment and configuration but circa VMware's 5th birthday (circa ESXi 3.0/3.5) it wasn't that easy to install either, and there certainly wasn't the range of products that we have today. However given the number of different products VMware offers for different purposes, I think, at least at a 30,000 foot view that it is clear that the number of products/programs between VMware based solutions and OpenStack based solutions is very similar.

From everything I have seen so far, I still feel that OpenStack is more suited for organizations that can dedicate development resources to maintaining their infrastructure, versus developing business applications.

Also Sorry for the click bait title :)
