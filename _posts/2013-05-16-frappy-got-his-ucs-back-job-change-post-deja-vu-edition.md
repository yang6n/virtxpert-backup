Every now and again (I would imagine) you get that phone call to change jobs - a great job opportunity; everything you have ever wanted to do only to find it was all smoke and mirrors.  As luck would have it, the company I left for just such a false opportunity wanted me back so I am headed back to <a href="http://www.lifeimage.com/" target="_blank">lifeIMAGE</a> as a Senior IT Administrator.  We have a great stack of technology - multiple data centers, top of the line gear and a very interesting road map for leveraging cloud technology down the road.   Since I try to docu-blog I hope this means a bit more articles here and a bit more activity for me on the EMC and VMware forums.

In addition to working with great technology, the product we make - even if just some small/tiny part, is built to help people - makes waking up in the morning and feeling like your work has a purpose a lot easier!
