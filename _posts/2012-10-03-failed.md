Well that sucked, 3 days later I am over it...a bit.  I am not upset that I failed but upset I got away from my original plan of how/what/when to study for my VCP5-DV.  Here is my plan.
<ul>
	<li>Test rescheduled Tuesday.</li>
	<li>Practices test and re-reading key chapters from Scott Lowe's vSphere book - primarily on HA/DRS, Storage, Monitoring and VUM.</li>
	<li>Mike Preston's OMG Study Guide Monday night for last minute cram/refresh</li>
	<li>Marking questions I am not totally sure of, but ONLY changing answers if another question later on helps me figure out a better answer.</li>
	<li>I am boycotting reading about the VSA and VDR since I got slammed with Q's on my first test (okay not really just being annoyed about that).  I will probably read the tech white paper on both this weekend.</li>
</ul>
