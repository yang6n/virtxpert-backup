With converged infrastructure appliances (compute, storage, networking) being all the rage, why haven't we seen such a device from the likes of EMC, HP or NetApp yet?  With Nutanix and Simplivity, and to a lesser extent Scale being fairly popular choices I would have expected such a device from the large storage and server vendors by now; Dell after all jumped right in with the <a href="http://www.virtxpert.com/dell-vrtx-game-changer-or-just-another-product-dellef/" target="_blank">VRTX</a> (though there is not support for clustering multiple VRTX's (yet?)) earlier this year.

Storage arrays, are for the most part, have been <em>almost</em> been ready for such a convergence - they contain CPU's for data processing, drives for storage and some type of interconnect to have them all talk to each other.  So why haven't others followed along?  Nutanix was able to build a very compelling product in just a couple of years, I would think with the resources someone like EMC has that they could turn such a product around in a few months (though the UI would not be very good;).  These "next gen" converged platforms should provide simplicity both in scaling the environment, and for support which I think is a huge factor with companies constantly trying to cut cost.  Even if I have to give up a feature or two to go with a converged appliance, that may be acceptable when I offset the cost of having to maintain expertise in house or thought consultants in the compute, networking and storage areas.

EMC would seem to have the leg up on such a product, after all with their stake in VMware, and VMware releasing VSAN that it would already be in the works.  Any bets as to who will be the next vendor to release such a product?
