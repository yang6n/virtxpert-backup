I selected the Corsair 230T case after being disapointed in the  <a title="Thermaltake Chaser A21 Case Review" href="http://www.virtxpert.com/thermaltake-chaser-a21-case-review/">Thermaltake Chaser A21</a> case for my lab.  The Corsair 230T is fantastic case, with plenty of room inside.  It is a bit wider than the A21, but that is by design as you can route cables under the mounting plate for the motherboard instead of over and across motherboard components.  Not only that, but out of the box you can install up to 4x 2.5" drives and 4x 3.5" drives at the same time, assuming your motherboard supports 8 drives or you have an additional SATA controller.  Using the <a title="8-Core, 32GB RAM, 360GB Flash, 2TB, Dual-NIC Home Lab Part List" href="http://www.virtxpert.com/8-core-32gb-ram-360gb-flash-2tb-dual-nic-home-lab-part-list/">ICY 2.5" mounting kits I am using in my 8-core home lab build</a>, you could actually mount 12x 2.5" drives in this case!  While it was a bit more expensive than the A21, it is a more sturdy case with better drive mounting options and comes with 3 case fans, as opposed to just one in the A21 case; that could easily make up the $20 difference.  The only item that might catch you off guard, and I actually like this now that I figured it out, you mount the hard drives with the connectors facing the inside of the case.  Really no big deal and keeps the cables pretty neat!

<strong>Pros</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Very sturdy case</li>
	<li>The bottom mount power bay fit the Raidmax 600AF perfectly</li>
	<li>Includes 3 case fans, check your motherboard to see how many you can support.  The TA970 AM3+ supports 2 without the need for splitters/adapters.</li>
	<li>Tool-less drive bays and side panels for up to 8 drives out of the box, or 12 2.5" drives with adapters</li>
	<li>Front panel 2x USB 3, check if your motherboard has a connector for that, the TA970 AM3+ does not.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cons</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Honestly, none that I have found but if I am going to nip pick, it would have been nice to get an optional cable kit for the front USB 3.0 ports to use USB 2.0 instead, but that's only because my motherboard doesn't have a USB 3.0 connector.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Summary</strong>

This is quite possibly the best case you can pick up for building a "beast" home lab like my quad-core or 8-core build as there is plenty of room for drives, easy cable management and and included fans in the price.
