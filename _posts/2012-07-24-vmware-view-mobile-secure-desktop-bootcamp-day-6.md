Sorry for the lack of notes, have setup enough radius servers that it all made sense. Â Still a good view though, nice to see PhoneFactor still around!!

VMware View Mobile Secure Desktop Bootcamp - Day 6

Setting Up Radius 2-Factor Authentication Best Practices

- Intro to radius Auth
- Setup radius
- Config View for radius
- HA for radius
- Troubleshooting

Radius used for AAA, RFC 2865 2866
View 5.1 and newer for 2 factor auth
View user supplies credentials, view connection server talks to Radius

Setup radius
Config view for radius via view admin
- If RSA SecurID, use that instead of radius

If multiple, setup on each connection server - select/existing created for first server
