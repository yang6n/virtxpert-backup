Recently I had the opportunity to discuss social enterprise platforms with <a href="https://plus.google.com/100865129140572944531/posts" target="_blank">Duane Craig</a> at TechRepublic, a technology that interests me as much as virtualization (two pretty different things I know).  I have been involved in several "internal social" platform projects and this was certainly a fun opportunity to discuss what I have learned and experienced over the years.

From the article:
<blockquote>When enterprises consider setting up their own social media networks, it’s to offer much more than just a place for idle chatter or a technological replacement for the watercooler. In fact, many people now think that using social processes within the business will be transformative across the enterprise. That’s because putting social into business processes leverages the untapped potential of employees, partners, and stakeholders, while also returning control of data to the brand and improving customer relationships.

Jonathan Frappier, director of technical operations at <a href="http://www.lightwire.info/">LightWire, Inc.</a>, and an independent consultant and blogger at <a href="http://www.virtxpert.com/">VIRTXPERT</a>, dove into the enterprise social media waters with one of the first companies he worked for when it built a web-based community for CIOs. Ever since then he’s advocated their use. Frappier says the variety of names being used to describe these enterprise social media efforts really only denote differences in complexities and at their hearts they’re all about new ways for people to have conversations, instead of relying on just email.

He cites the advantage of opening up communication to everyone in the organization, across all departments, and how empowering that can be for bringing in new perspectives and ideas. Other advantages he points to include:
<ul>
	<li>Creating a searchable knowledge base that everyone in the organization can benefit from even if they weren’t directly involved in the original conversations.</li>
	<li>Allowing companies to connect with their employees much like public social media allows individuals to do on the personal level.</li>
	<li>Offering a more modern document management system allowing collaboration on documents that used to be passed around in email or file sharing.</li>
	<li>Expanding business intelligence efforts so every document, and even perhaps conversations, are indexed.</li>
</ul>
