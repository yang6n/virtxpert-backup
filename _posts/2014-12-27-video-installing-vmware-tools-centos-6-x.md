This is a video demonstration on installing VMware Tools in CentOS 6.x. The assumptions for this walk through are you have access to VMware Workstation or the vSphere Client to initiate the VMware Tools installation and at least 1 E1000 network card to provide internet access. VMware Tools is needed for VMXNET3, so you will at least initially need an E1000 to provide network access for Perl, or local Perl installers to run the installer.
