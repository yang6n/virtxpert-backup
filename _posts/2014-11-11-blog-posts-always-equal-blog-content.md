So it has been an interesting blogging week for me.  I am taking part in the Virtual Design Master #vDM30in30 challenge - 30 blog posts in 30 days.  I've learned a few things in the past 10 days:
<ol>
	<li>Blogging is a marathon, not a sprint.  I needed to rebuild my home lab, it lined up nicely with #vDM30in30 so I cranked out about 8-9 blog posts the first day.  A) it was exhausting mentally, B) while I was writing blog posts, I was necessarily writing content - what do I mean?</li>
	<li>Posts versus content.  Writing a good blog post requires quite a bit of thought.  I've seen a few similar posts from others about the respect they have for people like Chis Wahl who is constantly creating quality content on his blog.  As I've gone though the last 10 days I have tried to bring my post further along than I did in the beginning to see if I could increase the quality of the posts and make them more relevant.</li>
	<li>If you rush, you will make mistakes.  For crying out loud I misspelled VMware "Workstation" 13 times.... THIRTEEN!  I partially blame my copy editing department, you know the grammar police on Twitter for not catching it sooner :)  I kid of course, I was rushing and needed to slow down.  I found errors in just about every post I wrote.</li>
	<li>While I am sticking with the challenge, my goal once #vDM30in30 is over is to go back to more focused posts that has a bit more relevance and less repetition than what is out there - though I guess its good now that I have some of this content on my blog!</li>
</ol>
Back to work and to thinking up blog posts :)
