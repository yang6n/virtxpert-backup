Today, Zerto has released version 3 of the Disaster Recovery (DR) solution; Zerto Virtual Replication.  For those unfamiliar with Zerto, they provide a complete software solution (e.g. no hardware appliances) to build, test and automate disaster recovery for your virtual environment (currently only VMware only).  Zerto is able to replicate between dissimilar storage devices and because they do not rely on snapshots can offer continuous replication for sub 1 minute RPO's.  Version 3 ships with a list of new improvements including:
<ul>
	<li>Replication of VM's between hosts managed by the same vCenter</li>
	<li>Automated fail over AND fail back</li>
	<li>Enhanced reporting</li>
	<li>New web user interface</li>
</ul>
If you do not have a DR plan, you might want to get on that; especially with hurricane season and winter coming!  Also released today is their "<a href="http://www.zerto.com/disaster-recovery-tool-kit/?virtxpert" target="_blank">DR Toolkit</a>" which helps <del>Zerto collect your email address</del> (love ya meant it Zerto:) )you understand some basics of DR as well as check the state of your DR plan.  You can read the full announcement from Zerto <a href="http://www.zerto.com/zerto-virtual-replication-3-0-is-here/" target="_blank">here</a> on Virtual Replication v3.  My only complain with Zerto is they have not addressed physical systems, for those that 100% virtual this isn't a problem, but could be a concern those still supporting physical workloads (Zerto hint; you should be able to do something with FalconStor doing a backup of physical systems).
