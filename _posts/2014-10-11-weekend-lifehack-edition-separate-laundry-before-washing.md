I know, totally random right?  I'll throw this into the section Igor Bril inspired - <strong><a class="row-title" title="Edit “A page for aspiring VMware admins who cant balance a checkbook, hate grocery shopping, dont know whether to buy a condo or know how to use Twitter”" href="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1606&amp;action=edit">A page for aspiring VMware admins who cant balance a checkbook, hate grocery shopping, dont know whether to buy a condo or know how to use Twitter</a>.</strong>

So here is the basic lifehack, my wife and I have always just thrown our laundry in a hamper/basket/pile on the floor depending on where said hamper is.  It's all inter mingled, goes in the washing machine intermingled and comes out intermingled.  Then when we are putting it away it has to be sorted out which takes like forever and is possibly the worst part of doing the laundry.  So, what's a person to do?

Keep your laundry sorted in the hamper/basket/floor pile.  Now, when my wife or I do the laundry all of her clothes go in at once and come out at once.  When we take it out of the dryer its coming out already somewhat sorted making the put away task go much quicker.  When you take it out of the dryer group the clothes together like you would putting them away.  For example all the socks or t-shirts that go in a drawer or on a shelf together so you can take them out all at once and put them away.  Boom - I can put all our laundry away in just a couple of minutes.
