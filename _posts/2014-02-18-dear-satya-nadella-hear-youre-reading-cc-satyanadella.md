Dear Satya Nadella,

Can you please make sure future versions of major products are compatible at launch - Exchange, Windows, SharePoint etc...?  I'd hate to have to roll out the brand new version of Exchange on an old OS again.  Also, while you are at that, can you please make sure you are including your vendors/partners in the new product launch.  It was quite frustrating that I had essentially no backup options when Exchange 2013 launched.  I'd rather have to wait an extra month for Exchange 201x to know that it will come out with support for the latest OS and that my backup vendors application will be able to support it.

Please, for the love of technology, stop trying to be Apple.  Windows Phone 8 is nice, don't abandon it.  Keep offering incentives for app developers, the only reason I'm not an every day user is because of the lack of apps.  While we're talking about Apple, here is there number - <strong>(877) 412-7753</strong>, there is a guy named Tim Cook there; ask for him.  Please help them make OSX integrate with Active Directory and be able to read Group Policies without 3rd party plugins that break every time Apple updates the OS.<strong>
</strong>

Finally, please don't think you have to beat everyone at everything.  F5 and Citrix make good load balancers, VMware and Citrix make good hypervisors.  Keep rocking the products you already rock, make them awesomer instead of more frustrating (going to pick on Exchange 2013 and Windows 2012 again...).  Although if you really want to fight everyone just buy Citrix.

Thanks
