<em>**Disclaimer:  Infinio is a sponsor of virtxpert.com - I was not asked to write this article, I am simply sharing the news about the new features from a great product**</em>

While at VMworld I learned that Infinio has announced a new version of Infinio Accelerator which now supports block storage protocols (iSCSI, FC, and FCoE) as well as NAS (NFS).  Infinio came out of beta last year at VMworld with their RAM based read cache solution for NAS storage.  Now companies who need to accelerate traditional block are also able to do so with the easy to install Infinio Accelerator.

<h3>From the press release:</h3>
<blockquote>In addition to support for the NFS storage protocol, v2.0 will also include full support for Fibre Channel, iSCSI, FCoE, and environments with multiple protocols. No matter which storage protocol customers choose, the Infinio user experience remains the same, including wizard-driven installation, zero operational impact, and instant access to advanced reporting.</blockquote>
In addition to block storage support, Infinio also announced application level reporting and a sizing adviser to help you determine how much memory to allocate to cache.  You can sign up to be notified when the beta of version two will be available at here: <a href="http://www.infinio.com/infinio-accelerator-20" target="_blank">http://www.infinio.com/infinio-accelerator-20</a>.  If you are at VMworld this week, swing by booth 623 for a demo.
