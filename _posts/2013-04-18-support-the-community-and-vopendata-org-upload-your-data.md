I have been meaning to get the vMA and PowerCLI running in my lab for a few weeks, and <a href="https://twitter.com/vopendata" target="_blank">vOpenData</a> was the last push I needed.  For those that are not familiar (how can you not be with @lamw and @wazoo behind it), the project is a community driven database about virtual infrastructure configurations.  As mentioned, you will need to download either the vMA or PowerCLI.  I opted the PowerCLI route, downloaded the scripts from the GitHub page at <a href="https://github.com/vopendata/scripts">https://github.com/vopendata/scripts</a>.  The script processed very quickly and produced a zip file of the data it collected, feel free to poke open the zip file and have a look, especially if you want to be sure you aren't giving away any sensitive data (just don't edit the files).

There is a public dashboard available that shows how many infrastructures are included, average VMDK size, top operating systems etc...  The data collected is completed anonymous - nothing specific about your environment that could cause a compromise is collected (don't believe me, some of mine is below) and collecting this type of data only supports everyone in the VMware community by making this data available.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/vopen.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-749" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" alt="vopen" src="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/vopen.jpg" width="1012" height="431" /></a></p>
Once the script is run, you can log into vOpenData.org, click on Infrastructures and click the New Infrastructure button, answer a few questions and then upload your zip file.

Here is an example of the data collected about the infrastructure.
