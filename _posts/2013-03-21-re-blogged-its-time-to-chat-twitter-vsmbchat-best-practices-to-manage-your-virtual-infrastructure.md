For VMware’s upcoming Twitter #vSMBChat, we will be exploring best practices in virtual infrastructure management. Topics will range from what are common issues and how can they be avoided to what management tools exist and which are the best to use. Joining us to moderate will be Alan Renouf (<a href="http://twitter.com/alanrenouf" target="_blank">@alanrenouf</a>) and special guest, Jonathan Frappier (<a href="http://twitter.com/jfrappier" target="_blank">@jfrappier</a>).

Taking your infrastructure virtual can cut costs as well as address capacity issues your company may be facing, but it can also be daunting. Virtualization is such a profound change to how systems operate that it not only creates new management requirements, but it also breaks many legacy management solutions.

We would like to invite service providers, partners or anyone interested in IT and virtual infrastructure management to join us for our <strong>#vSMBchat </strong>on <strong>Wednesday, March 27th at 10 am PT</strong> on Twitter.<strong> </strong>
