<strong>About the book</strong>

The author starts the book with some very good benefits of desktop virtualization, above and beyond those many server administrators already know from their server virtualization projects. The chapters are broken down to focus on specific components needed in your View environment such as Connection (Chapter 2), Transfer (4) and Security (5) servers.  My review comes from the perspective of being a server administrator for most of my career, having only setup View in lab or POC environments.

Using Chapter 1 and 2 as an example, the book does a very good job of giving a high level overview of the components and infrastructure requirements.  I very much appreciate how the author also looks at and explains external factors that may require 3rd party solutions to implement - something you may not find in a book directly from a vendor.  For example, one of my favorite parts of Chapter 1 is the in-depth example of how to use Windows Performance Monitor to capture statistics from a reference machine to help in understanding sizing requirements for your specific needs; yes even Chapter 1 normally reserved for boring introductions is worth reading.  In chapter 2 the author reviews load balancing considerations for your View connection server.  The chapters that follow use a similar format and are full of great information and examples.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

I believe this book is an excellent resource for anyone considering a virtual desktop (VDI) deployment project or those who want a better understanding of the topic.  The examples in the book are both concise and relevant and the author has a very good flow from one subject to the next. There is enough technical detail to be well versed in requirements, setup and support for VMware View 5.2.
