Thought it was to good not to share, if you are thinking of trying <a href="http://ansible.refr.cc/9KG5XP3" target="_blank">Ansible Tower</a>, you can save 20% off the annual subscription on the Ansible Tower Starter Kit - that's almost $200 off the $999 annual subscription. If you were thinking of trying it out and paying the $99 monthly term ($1188/yearly) that's almost a $400 savings.

The Ansible Tower Starter kit is good for up to 100 hosts - VMs or physical boxes. Ansible is agentless, you need only be able to SSH to your linux hosts or via PowerShell remoting for Windows.

You can check out my <a href="http://www.virtxpert.com/tag/ansible/">Ansible posts</a> and the <a href="http://professionalvmware.com/vbrownbag-devops-series/" target="_blank">#vBrownBag DevOps sessions</a> to learn more. Use <a href="http://ansible.refr.cc/9KG5XP3" target="_blank">this link</a> (http://ansible.refr.cc/9KG5XP3) to get the code for 20% off during checkout.
