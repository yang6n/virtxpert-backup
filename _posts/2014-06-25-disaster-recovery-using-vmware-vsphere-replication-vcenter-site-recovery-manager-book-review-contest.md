<em>**Disclaimer:  I have previously published a book with Packt Publishing.  This book review was not approved or seen in advance of Packt Publishing and is my own opinion.  This book was provided to me at not cost to read and review**</em>

Long book title, long blog post title!  Packt Publishing has given me the opportunity to review Disaster Recovery using <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/disaster-recovery-using-vmware-vsphere-replication-and-vcenter-site-recovery-manager/book?utm_source=mention.com&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=Disaster%20Recovery%20using%20VMware%20vSphere%20Replication%20and%20vCenter%20Site%20Recovery%20Manager">VMware vSphere Replication and vCenter Site Recovery Manager</a> (<a style="color: #1155cc;" href="http://bit.ly/1kosrhz" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1kosrhz</a><i style="color: #222222;"><b>)</b></i>.

The book is very straight forward and is very easily consume.  The book covers installation and configuration of VMware Site Recovery Manager and vSphere Replication.  While the book is mostly a step by step guide, the author does include design and installation considerations where appropriate as well as a review of background tasks happening which might not otherwise be controlled by the administrator; for example the cleanup tasks after testing a recovery.

Even though the book is on the shorter side, it is a worthy read for anyone interested in implementing either VMware SRM, vSphere Replication or both.

Packt has also provided me with 2 eBook copies to give away for readers of my blog.  To participate, please follow me on Twitter @jfrappier and re-tweet this article by July 3rd or use click on Tweet button: <a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=I%20just%20entered%20to%20win%20a%20copy%20of%20Disaster%20Recovery%20using%20VMware%20SRM%20via%20@PacktPub%20@jfrappier%20http://bit.ly/1kosrhz"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2296" src="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/tweet.png" alt="tweet" width="62" height="23" /></a>  (be sure to include my Twitter handle, @jfrappier so that I can track the RTs if you are using something like Buffer which may not show an RT on the original tweet).  Only July 4th, I will select two winners.
