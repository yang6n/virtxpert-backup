Recently, there was a a study that showed that many IT Managers were unaware of what virtualization is.  There could be a number of reasons, but it was still fairly shocking to me - maybe they are in large enough companies where they are removed from the infrastructure, or maybe there are just that many people living under a rock?  Either way our friends over at TrainSignal (Now PluralSight) have some interesting numbers as to why you should learn about virtualization if you don't already (and for those who do, further validating why we need to keep learning and growing).
