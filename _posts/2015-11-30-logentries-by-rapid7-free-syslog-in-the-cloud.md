Some people turn off cookies, me... I love them. Every now and again I am reminded of something on eBay or Amazon I looked at, and more often than not I find a little gem like LogEntries by Rapid7.

LogEntries is a log management system, think along the lines of LogInsight and Splunk, but in the cloud. The <a href="https://logentries.com/get-started/?le_trial=loglady-adrollp-728x90&amp;utm_campaign=loglady&amp;utm_source=adrollp&amp;utm_medium=728x90" target="_blank">first 5GB per day is completely free</a> (as long as you are cool with your logs being shipped to Rapid7) and signup actually works (not like those companies who make you talk to a person first!!). Once you sign up, you chose how you want to send your logs, either via an OS agent, standard syslog tools like Rsyslog, Syslog-NG, or Snare or even from supported applications such as PHP or Ruby.
