A few years ago I had a question come up during an interview, the question very simply was "What are the most important factors for you to succeed at this job"?  I thought about it for a few moments, as you shouldn't be afraid to think in an interview, and my answer was (which I stand by still today)
<ol>
	<li>Understand the business requirements and impact of whatever it is you are doing</li>
	<li>Document those business requirements and turn them into aligned IT procedures and policies</li>
	<li>Standardize your hardware and software platforms, aligned with the business and IT policies</li>
	<li>Automate, and if it were today I would have said "<a href="http://professionalvmware.com/vbrownbag-automate-all-the-things-training-schedule/" target="_blank">Automate All the Things</a>" (because well you should have a sense of humor)</li>
	<li>Security</li>
</ol>
After giving my answer, the person I would be reporting to had a funny look on his face and asked why security was number 5 (I was interview for a Director of IT and Security position), he thought I would have said it should be first.  Here the reasons why each of the others rank above security.  A little disclaimer before you keep reading, I tried - on purpose, to use very generic examples.  As a tech geek you might questions some of these scenarios but they are meant to explain a scenario, not a specific technical problem.

First, in any technology role today - whether its a director role, a systems engineer role, developer, pre-sales or even a role whose sole focus is security you have to understand your organizations business strategy, any and all regulations you may have to adhere to, contractual obligations to your customers and how you service your customers.  Without understanding the business you can't possibly make informed technology based decisions to better serve the organization.

Second, "Document All the Things" - knowing them is useful, but writing them down so EVERYONE knows them and building your IT policies and procedures around those business needs is also very critical.  While there are some basic principals and practices, account lockout threshold for example, that tend to stretch across various industries and regulations, there are many more that will be unique to your customers and your organizations mission.

Third, without standardizing, how can I possibly implement standards that can be enforced through out the organization?  If one of my policies is to ensure the latest .NET patches are pushed in a timely manner, but not every server runs the same version of .NET how can I be sure anything I tired to automate is working 100% of the time?  Maybe each .NET version is fully patched, but maybe I end up with servers running with different versions, creating support and security problems in the process.

Fourth, now that I know my business needs, have documented my processes and standardized on technology which my organization is using, I should now be able to automate many (all?) routine tasks to remove human intervention.  The reason automation comes before security is quite simple, I can't secure against human error.  If we are not automating, we are not secure regardless of how awesome we are at our jobs.  We are humans, we will always make mistakes, generally at the worst time possible.

With the first 4 items out of the way, I should (as a good technologist) have almost by default built security into the technology/IT business processes.  In many ways, security shouldn't even be on the list, security isn't a product or even a science, its an art and has to be achieved; not implemented.  This thought process of IT, even thought I think it is very sound and strong, has caused some pain; specifically during acquisitions when dealing with departments whose sole focus is security and place security #1, before understanding the business.

Care to share your thoughts?  What would your #5 be if its not security?
