Seems like everyone is writing a "predictions" post for 2013, so I figured I would join in the fun.  Here are my predictions for 2013:
<ul>
	<li>Vendors will continue to use the word "cloud" to describe everything from SaaS to Iaas to Whoknowswhat-aaS and confuse businesses and consumers alike.</li>
	<li>Start-ups will continue to launch their products on IaaS providers (what I consider to be "cloud").</li>
	<li>Established companies will move workloads to Iaas providers.</li>
	<li>Both will ignore high availability and SLA best practices and blame those vendors when there is an outage instead of building highly redundant/available sites.</li>
	<li>Companies that make IaaS providers easier to use will pop up more and more.  Companies like Maderia Cloud and RightScale will become more prominent.</li>
	<li>Everyone will still be talking about OpenStack this time next year.</li>
	<li>VMware will become a bigger player in the IaaS space when vCloud Service comes out of beta (I wouldn't trust production workloads to a beta service).</li>
	<li>Companies that build hybrid architectures for easily moving workloads between local "cloud" and public "cloud" services will have an advantage to those who have purely done one or the other.</li>
	<li>DRaaS will explode, most will have built their own data centers and not be using public IaaS providers.</li>
</ul>
Hope that was an entertaining list for you, do you agree or disagree with any of the above?
