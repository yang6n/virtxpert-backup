<a href="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/synology-rs.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2355" src="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/synology-rs.jpg" alt="synology-rs" width="382" height="135" /></a>Synology has just announced a new 5 year warranty for several of their models, making a great product even more desirable!  Synology has made excellent storage devices for small and medium sized businesses for many years and they clearly look to continue that with this warranty update.  There are those that believe that SMB's do not need shared storage and should just be using DAS to save on cost.  However, doing this limits an SMBs ability to maintain automated fail over and high availability like VMware's HA.  Having worked with many SMBs and start-ups I can tell you that up time is critical and being able to leverage products that can take advantage of shared storage is critical.  Is it more expensive that DAS?  Of course but what is the cost of downtime or outages?  Having to constantly rely on full machine restores as your "HA" is not an option.

Model's that include the new 5 year warranty are: <a href="http://www.synology.com/en-global/products/overview/RS10613xs%2B" target="_blank">RS10613xs</a>+, <a href="http://www.synology.com/en-us/products/overview/RS3614xs+" target="_blank">RS3614xs</a>+, <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/overview/RS3614xs" target="_blank">RS3614RPxs</a>, <a href="http://www.synology.com/en-us/products/overview/RS3614xs+" target="_blank">RS3614xs</a>, <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/overview/RX1213sas" target="_blank">RX1213sas</a>, <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/overview/RX1214" target="_blank">RX1214</a>, <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/overview/RX1214" target="_blank">RX1214RP</a>

These are excellent products for both iSCSI block storage and NAS (NFS/CIFS) services.  Beyond basic storage you can encrypt and replicate data.  I have also used their smaller models for specific solutions such as video monitoring which works great - rather than constantly recording they can detect motion, start recording when motion is detected and email images to a specified address - a great option for businesses needing to add video monitoring to help safe guard important data.

If you are considering shared storage, either via iSCSI or NFS/CIFS add Synology to your list for consideration.  Check out <a href="http://www.synology.com/en-us/solution/business_storage" target="_blank">http://www.synology.com/en-us/solution/business_storage</a> for more information
