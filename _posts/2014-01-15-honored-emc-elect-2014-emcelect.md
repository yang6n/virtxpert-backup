EMC has announced their 2014 class of EMC Elect and I am honored to be part of the group and looking forward to the opportunity to continue giving back to the community and to EMC.  So, what does being an EMC Elect change for me?  Nothing really.  I have longed believed EMC has had a great portfolio, and a great product.  But its not always the right product.  I think their is a lot of potential with some of their software solutions.  But I will maintain my criticalness on products like Networker and Avamar who, in my opinion, should have a better user experience that what they currently provide given EMC's pockets.  I will continue to look at new solutions and continue to push EMC to make those easy to consume.  If I can enable VSAN in a few clicks, my expectation won't be far off for ScaleIO.  I will continue to look at all aspects of a solution and, where appropriate recommend EMC to friends and colleagues and hope that being part of this group provides access to giving feedback, both positive and where there can be improvements, to EMC.
