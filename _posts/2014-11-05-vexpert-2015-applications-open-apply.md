Across the Twitters today came the notification that many people eagerly await - vExpert nominations are open.  This year it was opened up a bit early it seems but I like that.  So the question is - should you apply?  I think most people do but I see many people trying to get the vExpert award, versus being awarded with the vExpert title.  What do I mean by that?  I am glad you asked.  In my opinion the vExpert program, and others like it such as the EMC Elect and PernixPro programs celebrate those who give back to the community through various methods of contribution.  Are you active in the community, whether blogging, on the VMTN forums or  on social media using tools such as Twitter?  If yes then my question for you is why?  Are you there to connect with and meet others who share common interests?  If yes so far you are on the right track.  Are you there to engage in conversation with your peers about those common interests?  If that is still a yes it seems like you get it.  Are you there just to promote your blog so you get the vExpert award?  If you answered yes to that one then you may want to ask yourself why - if you are blogging only for recognition is that really the point?  I started blogging and being active on social media because I wanted to connect with my peers and found it is a better means of collaboration than email or forums, I didn't even know what the vExpert program was when I started yet in my first year I received the award and was quite honored.  I'm glad to receive the award not because I try to get it, but because the people that run the program find what I do to be valuable to the community, hopefully that will continue in 2015!
<h3>As in the past there are 3 paths to be a vExpert</h3>
<h3>Evangelist Path</h3>
The Evangelist Path includes book authors, bloggers, tool builders, public speakers, VMTN contributors, and other IT professionals who share their knowledge and passion with others with the leverage of a personal public platform to reach many people. Employees of VMware can also apply via the Evangelist path. A VMware employee reference is recommended if your activities weren’t all in public or were in a language other than English.
<h3>Customer Path</h3>
The Customer Path is for leaders from VMware customer organizations. They have been internal champions in their organizations, or worked with VMware to build success stories, act as customer references, given public interviews, spoken at conferences, or were VMUG leaders. A VMware employee reference is recommended if your activities weren’t all in public.
<h3>VPN (VMware Partner Network) Path</h3>
The VPN Path is for employees of our partner companies who lead with passion and by example, who are committed to continuous learning through accreditations and certifications and to making their technical knowledge and expertise available to many. This can take shape of event participation, video, IP generation, as well as public speaking engagements. A VMware employee reference is required for VPN Path candidates.

You can <a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/" target="_blank">apply to the 2015 vExpert program between now and December 12th</a>.  Good luck and happy collaborating!
