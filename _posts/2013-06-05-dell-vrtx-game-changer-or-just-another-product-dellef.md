At the Dell Enterprise Forums (#dellef on Twitter), Dell announced a new product - the <a href="http://www.dell.com/Learn/us/en/555/shared-infrastructure" target="_blank">VRTX</a> (<em>pron Ver-Tex</em>).  It is a 5U chassis that can stand as a tower or as a traditional rack mount unit, contains 4 blades, up to 48TB of storage and can run on 110V (important for many SMB's and branch offices).  While quite impressive, it seems to be the next iteration of the C series chassis that were around for a few years without much fanfare.  Also, this is not a one of a kind product.  They are now in a market with the likes of Nutanix and SuperMicro (I want to put Simplivity in this list but not 100% sure its the same type of converged infrastructure product) who have made similar products for years and Nutanix may be one of the fast growing tech companies, if measure by nothing else just look at the talent they have hired over the last few months.  Price will determine how much traction the product gains; will it be priced such that only large enterprises can consider for the branch office needs (and how many branch offices need up to 4 blades) or will the SMB be able to leverage this product as well?

Here is the official video from Dell:

I am very interested in the product, but have the following questions for Dell:
<div>
<ul>
	<li>How is this different than the C series servers?  Seems just like marketing spin on an existing product?</li>
	<li>How do you compare to Nutanix?</li>
	<li>Are all of the disks shared among all 4 servers (SAN/NAS)</li>
	<li>  -- If so what is the protocol the host connect over - FC, iSCSI, NFS?</li>
	<li>or specific disk assigned to specific servers (DAS)?</li>
	<li>  -- If so how do you share the local data among different servers in the event of a host failure?</li>
	<li>Can I connect multiple VRTX's together?</li>
	<li>  -- If so are they managed as one logical group?</li>
	<li>  -- If so is the data shared across multiple chassis?</li>
	<li>What are the configuration options available:</li>
	<li>  -- Can I buy 1, 2 or 3 or 4 nodes to start or do I have to start with 4?</li>
	<li>  -- Can more disks be added later and integrated into an existing storage pool/LUN?</li>
	<li>  -- Can I integrate with an existing SAN?</li>
	<li>What is the cost for a typical config?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>

<strong></strong>This is a very interesting product offering from Dell, time will tell as more details and pricing emerge - I know I will be keeping an eye on it.
