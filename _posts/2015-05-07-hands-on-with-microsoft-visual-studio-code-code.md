As a Windows user I have been looking for a good markdown tool to write in, however most of the tools freely available have been mediocre at best. Enter Visual Studio Code, a (currently) free download from Microsoft that <img class="alignleft  wp-image-3744" src="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/code.png" alt="code" width="150" height="170" />supports Windows, OSX, and Linux (OSX/open source gear heads take notice - write software cross platform!). You can download Code without any login from <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">vistualstudio.com</a>.

Once downloaded, it is a pretty a-typical install, no next, next, next - it just works! The UI takes a bit of poking around to get comfortable with, but after just a few minutes all seemed to be working as expected.

Below you can see an example of some markdown syntax in Code.

The toolbar at the top of the image

allows you to change between split screen or single screen and, as I have done above show a preview of what you are writing. This is just a quick hands on, you can see how simple it is to get started. Now that I have found a tool that seems work properly in Windows, my next step is to find a tool for markdown presentations that is also easy to use (in Windows of course:) )
