On Friday,<a href="http://h30507.www3.hp.com/t5/Technical-Support-Services-Blog/Customers-for-life/ba-p/154423#.UvepYRBdWWY" target="_blank"> HP announced</a> that it would no longer provide firmware updates for <del>suckers like me</del> customers who no longer had active service contracts.  Customers who put their faith in HP because they made high quality devices that they were able to support for years because of the quality.  Well, now that's all gone.  If you aren't paying for renewals for your HP service contract then no firmware for you!  What made the blog post so infuriating is that HP had the audacity to title the announcement "Customers for life" - well HP I will tell you that I had been a customer for my entire IT career, even ousting other vendors in favor of your products but no more.  Next time I need to make a suggestion to a company it will NOT be HP.  Not on servers, not on switches, not on desktops or laptops.  Your blatant attempt to squeeze ever last ounce of money out of your customers is nothing short of Cisco-esque, except, at least on the networking side they make far superior devices.

Where did HP go wrong?  Well for starters pretending like you are doing your customers a favor with this change.  Unfortunately you have to realize that your customers are not dumb, and since most of us work in technology we see right though this.  Second I do not consider firmware updates "intellectual property" - I consider firmware updates bugs you should have fixed before taking my money!  If you want to charge me for major operating system updates, for example on your network devices, I'd actually be okay with that.  So long as the last major version I had support for continued to be provided bug fixes, whether or not I had an active contract.

I wonder how many customers walk over this change?  I for one need a switch in my home lab and I had been looking at using an HP but now that will be a Dell.  I'm done with you HP, consider this my breakup letter.
