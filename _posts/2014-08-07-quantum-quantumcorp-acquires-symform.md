<a href="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/quantum.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2457" src="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/quantum.png" alt="quantum" width="208" height="157" /></a>Who and who you say?  Remember back in the 90's....<a href="http://www.quantum.com/" target="_blank">Quantum</a>, those folks that made a hard drive you would consider after Seagate and Western Digital?  Yea those guys!  Well guess what they are still around and have some interesting backup options in the SMB space.  In fact, they offer their backup software - <a href="http://www.quantum.com/products/vmbackup/vmprosoftware/index.aspx" target="_blank">vmPRO</a> free up to 1TB and a virtual version of their backup and dedup appliance free up to 15GB.

What Quantum has lacked is a cloud service offering - enter the Symform acquisition.  Symform makes backup and file access software that is available across multiple devices.  Based on the press release, it sounds like Quantum is looking to integrate this into their existing offerings to have a cloud enabled solution.  Imagine running their vmPRO backup software to protect your VMs to a local NAS device or their virtual DXi V1000 AND then also being able to create offsite backups directly from the software or appliance.

From the <a href="https://blog.quantum.com/index.php/symform/" target="_blank">press release</a>:
<blockquote><span style="color: #5b5b5b;">Symform is based on software that allows data to be stored transparently in more than one location. Today this is just a horizontal cloud, but this capability allows Quantum to potentially expand the service to include directing one copy of a customer’s backup to stay onsite and a second copy to the cloud, in a hybrid onsite/offsite, but fully managed model.</span></blockquote>
If you are evaluating VM backup software, its certainly worth putting on the list.  I do wish they made registering for the free software a bit easier, I had previously registered but lost the key and when I go back there isn't a clear way to retrieve it, nor can I register again.  They'd also benefit from being a bit more social, I had trouble finding their Twitter account!
