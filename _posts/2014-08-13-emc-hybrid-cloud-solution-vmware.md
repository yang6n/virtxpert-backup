In case you missed it at EMC World, we built a working hybrid cloud during the show; the goal was to do it in less than 48 hours - it was achieved in a fraction of that.  You can catch the individual demos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA25JWylP7ffT7kQo2LEzr25eko-RGQs-" target="_blank">here</a> (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA25JWylP7ffT7kQo2LEzr25eko-RGQs-).  If you will be at VMworld in San Francisco next week, you can come by<a href="https://vmworld2014.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=3037&amp;tclass=popup#.U9ptke2KlxM?src=vmw_so_vex_jfrap_202" target="_blank"> session 3037 with Tyler Britten and Rick Scherer</a> as they will be talking about how you can leverage best practices to assemble intelligent components to rapidly deploy a hybrid cloud that delivers on-demand services in a multitenant, fully functional, integrated VMware and EMC solution stack.

The EMC Hybrid Cloud Solution is a fully configurable solution, with your choice of storage, backup, professional services and support all from EMC.  What I think is a great option for our customers is to have this solution fully supported by EMC.  For those that have built a "cloud" - whether private, public or hybrid on their own, I'm sure you have had a least one nightmare support situation with Vendor C blaming Vendor V (those letters were totally arbitrary and of course that didn't happen to me).

You also know that building a cloud (virtual data center, whatever you want to call it) requires multiple products that integrate together - that is why I believe this solution will shine.  You can see all of the various components used at <a href="https://store.emc.com/Product-Family/EMC-Cloud-Solutions/EMC-Hybrid-Cloud-Solution-with-VMware/p/EMC-Hybrid-Cloud-Solution" target="_blank">https://store.emc.com</a> (https://store.emc.com/Product-Family/EMC-Cloud-Solutions/EMC-Hybrid-Cloud-Solution-with-VMware/p/EMC-Hybrid-Cloud-Solution) or by watching the YouTube videos shared above.

For me personally, this project has been a dream.  It has combined all of the technologies I am interested in, being hands on with VMware, vCAC and ViPR as well as learning about new things such as vCHS, AppD and VMAX (I came from a VNX shop).  I have also been able to work with some amazingly smart people.  I came to EMC to push myself, and the firehose is nowhere near running dry.  I hope we can catch up at at  the <a href="https://vmworld2014.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=3037&amp;tclass=popup#.U9ptke2KlxM?src=vmw_so_vex_jfrap_202" target="_blank">How to Build and Deploy a Well Run Hybrid Cloud</a> session at VMworld.
