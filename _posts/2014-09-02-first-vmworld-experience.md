2014 marked my first VMworld, quite an amazing event.  Leading up to the event I booked sessions to attend and made note of Hands on Labs I wanted to take.  I was fortunate enough to fly into San Francisco (also my first time in SF) with a great friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/NerdBlurt" target="_blank">Luigi Danakos</a>, and then met up with <a href="https://twitter.com/rolltidega" target="_blank">Shawn Cannon</a> as he landed just about the same time we did.  We hopped a cab to Moscone, dropped our stuff off and registered for the event.  Once we hit the VMunderground Opening Acts put on by the #vBrownBag crew, I knew why I was here.

It wasn't for the keynote, that was a great experience and I am very excited about<a title="VMworld Day 1 – EVO:Rail and lots of vCloud Air" href="http://www.virtxpert.com/vmworld-day-1-evorail-lots-vcloud-air/" target="_blank"> EVO:Rail</a> and EVO:Rack.  It wasn't for the sessions, though I surely enjoyed the <a title="How to Build and Deploy a Well Run Hybrid Cloud #INF3037-SPO w/ @vmtyler &amp; @rick_vmwaretips #VMworld" href="http://www.virtxpert.com/build-deploy-well-run-hybrid-cloud-inf3037-spo-w-vmtyler-rick_vmwaretips-vmworld/" target="_blank">How to Build a Well Run Hybrid Cloud</a> session with <a href="https://twitter.com/rick_vmwaretips" target="_blank">Rick Scherer</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/vmtyler" target="_blank">Tyler Britten</a>.  It was the experience of meeting, talking and just hanging out with the community.  The EMC Hybrid Cloud session was so much more fun and interesting with <a href="https://twitter.com/banksek" target="_blank">Erin Banks</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/vTexan" target="_blank">Tommy Trodgen</a>, whom I met for the first time.  Supporting the #vBrownBag Tech Talks would have just felt like work had it not been for meeting, working with and having fun with <a href="http://twitter.com/cody_bunch" target="_blank">Cody Bunch</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/DemitasseNZ" target="_blank">Alastair Cooke</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/GreggRobertson5" target="_blank">Gregg Robertson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/anthonyrhook" target="_blank">Anthony Hook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kylemurley" target="_blank">Kyle Murley</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ThevCACGuy" target="_blank">Jon Harris</a> and then talking off Monday night to catch a San Francisco Giants game, over looking the bay with Gregg (his first American baseball game!), Anthony and Jon.

I was watching the keynote on day 2, chatting with a guy next to me; turns out that I often interact with him on the Spiceworks forums. I got to meet <a href="https://twitter.com/vcdx133" target="_blank">Rene Van Den Bedem</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mrlesmithjr" target="_blank">Larry Smith</a>.  Then <a href="https://twitter.com/kellandamm" target="_blank">Kellan Dam</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">m</span>, <a href="https://twitter.com/byronschaller" target="_blank">Byron Schaller</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/mwpreston" target="_blank">Mike Preston</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/discoposse" target="_blank">Eric Wright</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/AngeloLuciani" target="_blank">Angelo Luciani</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/vmiss33" target="_blank">Melissa Palmer</a>.  Lest I forget meeting <a href="https://twitter.com/FrankDenneman" target="_blank">Frank Denneman</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/scott_lowe" target="_blank">Scott Lowe</a>.

There are so many wonderful people who I met at VMworld that have been a huge help to me I can't possibly list them all.  And just when you get to the point where you think, what more could I possibly do - you end up at dinner with <a href="https://twitter.com/ExchangeGoddess" target="_blank">Phoummala Schmit</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Emad_Younis" target="_blank">Emad Younis</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/RuddyVCP" target="_blank">Kyle Ruddy</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jdgreen" target="_blank">James Green</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexanderJN" target="_blank">Alexander Nimmannit</a>.  You get a text from your friend and head out to vBeers <a href="https://twitter.com/HansDeLeenheer" target="_blank">Hans De Leenheer</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kasialorenc" target="_blank">Kasia Lorenc</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SFoskett" target="_blank">Stephen Foskett</a> before packing up and flying out with another friend you shared an apartment with all week and have an awesome Lyft to the airport and breakfast - thank you <a href="http://twitter.com/mjbrender" target="_blank">Matthew Brender</a>.

My one tip for anyone that hasn't been to a VMworld, go and leave plenty of time to meet the community, that was the most amazing experience of VMworld.
