NO MORE vRAM ENTITLEMENTS!  Okay well that's enough for me but I guess we can review some of the other <a href="http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/products/vsphere/vmware-what-is-new-vsphere51.pdf">items</a>.

- vCloud Suites

- New larger virtual machines, up to 64 vCPUs and 1TB of vRAM.  New virtual machine format, version 9 which according to the twittersphere should fix quite a few problems in View 5.1 from version 8.

- Updated Virtual Distributed Switch (vDS) proficing config backup and restore, roll back, and LACP.

- vSphere vMotion now works WITHOUT shared storage.

- vSphere replication of VMs over the LAN or WAN with RPO settings as low as 15 minutes.

- No reboot for new VMware Tools install.

- Updates to Storage DRS and Auto Deploy

- Updats to vSphere Web Client and Orchestrator
