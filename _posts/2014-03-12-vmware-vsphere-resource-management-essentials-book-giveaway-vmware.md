As many folks know by know, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/VMware-vSphere-Resource-Management-Essentials-ebook/dp/B00IJYDNYO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394626700" target="_blank">VMware vSphere Resource Management Essentials</a> from Packt Publishing is available from Packt's website or any number of retailers including Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble.  In addition to thanking Packt Publishing for giving me the opportunity to write this, I also want to thank the technical editors for helping make sure the book was well written and accurate and to people in the community like <a href="http://www.discoposse.com/" target="_blank">Eric Wright</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/discoposse" target="_blank">@discoposse</a>) who was always available if I need to bounce something off another brain..  As an "essentials" level book, I wrote this book to be a good introduction to vSphere, its concepts and features for administrators who are new to virtualization, or at least vSphere.  To celebrate, I'll be giving away a print copy (and hopefully some digital copies, but I'm still waiting on those).

To enter, simply re-tweet this link or tell me in a tweet why you'd like this book with a link to the post for a chance to enter.  I'll draw the winner on March 21st and contact you for your shipping information.
