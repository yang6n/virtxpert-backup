Dell has announced the new <a href="http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/poweredge-r920/pd" target="_blank">PowerEdge R920</a> server and its a beast.  The PowerEdge R920 supports up to 4-sockets and Intel's new 15-core Ivy Bridge processor.  You can configure the R920 with up to 4 Intel Xeon E7-4800 or E7-8800 or 2xE7-2800 processors and up to 6TB of RAM.  In addition to the memory and compute power, you have 24x 2.5" drive bays which can push 12Gbps SAS/SSD drives and up to 8x PCIe SSDs.   Not only does the R920 drive up the consolidation ratios for your virtual environment (it is compatible with ESXi as well as your standard OS) but its achieved <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/dell-blogs/dell4enterprise/b/dell4enterprise/archive/2014/02/18/our-top-of-the-line-server-for-your-most-demanding-workloads-the-dell-poweredge-r920.aspx" target="_blank">amazingly high benchmarks for both SAP and Oracle</a>.

This is certainly an amazing build, and can only imagine what is possible with these boxes running VMware VSAN.  I would like to see Dell, who has plenty of storage technology at their disposal, work on clustering technology for their servers.  They seem so close to being able to go hyper-converged and having this much power in a single chassis has me hoping this is on the horizon.
