Today I am at the Virtualization Technology User Group, VTUG for short, and while there are a lot of interesting vendors to meet and technology to learn about I find the most beneficial interactions are talking with peers and friends.  I am sitting down typing this blog post and having a conversation, not about virtualization, but about the benefits of relationships within a department/business unit.  It's one of the more enlightening conversations I have had about "work" in weeks.  If you have a local user group event in your area, for what ever your favorite piece of tech is, make sure you attend and don't be afraid to reach out to others who attend via social media to make your event even more enjoyable and meaningful.
