Back in September I finished my EMC Cloud Architect certification track, I blogged about the <a title="Exam Recap – EMC Cloud Infrastructure and Services #EMCProven #CloudArchitect" href="http://www.virtxpert.com/exam-recap-emc-cloud-infrastructure-services-emcproven-cloudarchitect/">EMCCIS</a> experience but never about the overall exam experience.  The Cloud Architect track is broken down into 3 separate exams:
<ol>
	<li>Cloud Infrastructure and Service (EMCCIS) which has just been updated to version 2.</li>
	<li>Virtual Data Center and Cloud Infrastructure Planning (EMCCA)</li>
	<li>IT-as-a-Service Planning and Design (EMCCAe)</li>
</ol>
<a href="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/EMC_proven_expert.blue-01-01.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2779" src="http://www.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/EMC_proven_expert.blue-01-01-658x1024.jpg" alt="EMC_proven_expert.blue-01-01" width="135" height="210" /></a>The<a href="https://education.emc.com/guest/campaign/CloudArchitect/default.aspx#course1" target="_blank"> entire certification track</a>, I feel, is a bit unique in our vendor driven exam world.  Now that is not a knock on vendor exams, I feel those are a good measuring stick of basic product knowledge (though that can be fudged) but the EMC Cloud Architect Expert exam is generally more focused on process and design versus specific product knowledge, though there are a few questions about specific  products over the three exams.  The last exam you need to pass in order to achieve the EMCCAe or Cloud Architect Expert designation is the IT-as-a-Service exam (E20-918).

Given my work experience as a manager/director in several organizations much of the ITaaS concepts were not new to me, things such as gathering business requirements, chargeback, and security and concepts around virtualization and cloud computing.  Having said that the course was built around the characteristics according to NIST and as such there may be some room for interpretation on how those characteristics apply to a business.  Given that most of the exams are not specificly product focused, it can make preparing for them a bit tricky as there is no clear cut answer to each and every question/scenario given on the exam like there would be for a Microsoft or VMware type exam that is focused on a specific set of rules such as how to enable vMotion for instance.

To give you a feel for the exam, and the format of the questions you can take the publicly available practice test for <a href="https://secure.testcraft.com/emc/Assess.aspx?guid=BF0E2890960B4D7D8B8459880F12F57E&amp;a=L1" target="_blank">E20-918</a>.  Other than understanding how to leverage the products specifically called out in <a href="https://education.emc.com/content/_common/docs/exam_descriptions/E20-918_IT_as_a_Service_Planning_and_Design.pdf" target="_blank">exam blueprint</a> I would spend time getting to know the <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-145/SP800-145.pdf" target="_blank">NIST documentation for cloud computing</a>, as well as the information on <a href="http://thecloudtutorial.com/cloudtypes.html" target="_blank">thecloudtutorial.com</a>, and  <a href="http://www.service-architecture.com/articles/cloud-computing/cloud_computing_definition.html" target="_blank">service-architecture.com</a>.  Now these sites are not going to give you answers to the exam, but I feel they do a good job of explaining cloud computing concepts which <em><strong>you</strong> </em>then need to apply to the scenarios given in the exam questions.

A quick plug for the EMC courses, those are the best source for learning specific to the exam, after all the exams are based on those courses much like the VCP is based around the vSphere Install, Configure, Manage course.

One final note to remember - no class or no exam can teach you how to apply concepts in all scenarios.  As an architect it is your job, your responsibility to understand the tools that are available to you and use your best judgement to apply those to a specific use case for the business you are supporting.  Next time you take a class or an exam, don't expect the instructors to be able to give you specific details on how to apply those tools to a specific use case, instead understand the capabilities of the tools so you can apply them across different scenarios you may encounter on your cloud architect journey.
