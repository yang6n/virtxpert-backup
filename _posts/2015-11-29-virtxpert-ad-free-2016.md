Starting on January 1st I will no longer be offering advertising on this blog. The reason is really two fold - first and foremost I will be honest and admit I felt pressure to "produce" for my advertisers. Self inflicted? Maybe... but there none the less. The second reason is I am quite simply not a sales person. I was spending time talking to potential advertisers when I could have been blogging. That is not an excuse for not blogging but there are only so many seconds left in the day after spending time with my family, continuing to learn new things, exercising, and paying the bills.

Rather than offer banner ads on the site, I will offer vendors the opportunity to have my write white papers or e-books on various virtualization related topics, product reviews or use cases. If you are interested in this service, please contact me and we can discuss what you are looking for.

A very big thank you to all of my advertisers from 2013, 2014, and 2015.
