As I caught up on my morning email, I received the announcement from Unitrends that they have agreed to acquire PHD Virtual, makers of ReliableDR.  Having been exposed recently to both Unitrends Enterprise Backup and PHD Virtual's ReliableDR I am very excited about the possibilities and future for both products.

Unitrends Enterprise Backup is very easy to use and configure, even with some bugs in their software dedup (any PostgreSQL experts at PHD Virtual?) and adding a robust DR product is very exciting.

Congratulations to the folks at PHD Virtual and at Unitrends for adding a great product to their portfolio.  You can read the <a href="http://www.unitrends.com/company/press-releases/2013/unitrends-acquires-phd-virtual;-builds-powerhouse" target="_blank">official announcement here</a>.
