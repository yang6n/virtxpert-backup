<a href="http://www2.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cloudcred.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-573" alt="cloudcred" src="http://www2.virtxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cloudcred.png" width="152" height="152" /></a>At the VMware Partner Exchange, VMware announced a new "community" (if you will) called <a href="https://www.cloudcredibility.com/" target="_blank">CloudCred</a>.  The purpose is to "get rewards for the things you know about the cloud – learn the things you don’t" (taken directly from the website - to learn more check out the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CSD1Kwq94M&amp;n=1363089757888&amp;url=http://vmware.com/go/cloudcredvideo&amp;usg=8s5hJSCllGJ2hjqy-N8xkSoAiYA." target="_blank">YouTube</a> video).  When you log into the site, you join a team and earn points for what many of us are already doing today - writing blog posts, sharing information and connecting on Twitter etc.  Since I wasn't involved in the meetings or brain storming sessions to come up with this, I have to assume it is meant to increase the evangelism of VMware products and offerings, though some of the "tasks" do bleed into other technologies and vendors - certainly a noble effort, well maybe more of a free marketing play but either way, I get it from that perspective.

Even as a relatively newcomer to social media, I wonder if this will really keep people engaged in what I think is already an amazing community of people who were opening sharing and connecting with people before, not just doing it for points and prizes.  I know I didn't get involved for prizes, I got involved because it is a great way to learn about a technology I am passionate about and also allowed me to connect with people on a personal level I may have not ever had the chance to meet.  I feel like I could travel to many areas of the country right now and have at least a few people I would love to grab dinner with and talk to.  There are already several community based programs that recognize contributors in this space - things like the vExpert or EMC Elect programs, or the recently published <a href="http://vsphere-land.com/news/top-blog-2012-results.html" target="_blank">top blogs</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/ericsiebert" target="_blank">Eric Siebert</a>.  These programs are based on peer recongnition, not a pre-defined task that I may feel compelled to do just to earn my points.

Needless to say, I am fairly torn on CloudCred right now, maybe I am a grump from the DST change but I feel like this will cause a brief uptick in engagement only to see a major drop off when people who are not normally engaged earn all their points.
