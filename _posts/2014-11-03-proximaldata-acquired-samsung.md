<em>*Disclaimer - ProximalData is a sponsor of this site.  I had no prior knowledge of the acquisition nor was I asked to write this post*</em>

Samsung <a href="http://global.samsungtomorrow.com/?p=44177" target="_blank">announced its acquisition ProximalData</a>, creators of AutoCache - an SSD server side caching solution.  While Samsung is well know for the SSD drives, I've not seen them as an enterprise or even SMB play however as their announcement clearly states, this acquisition is aimed at improving Samsungs competitiveness in the business segment.  I wonder what Samsung has up their sleeves next?  With no real enterprise or SMB array offering, could we see an acquisition of someone like Synology or Drobo by Samsung?

This isn't the first instance of mostly consumer focused company acquiring business tech.  In 2013 Imation (you know floppy disks and what not) acquired Nexsan, makers of the SATA and SAS Beasts (at the time) which have morphed into the E-series and newer NST series.  I'm surprise a bit that Imation wasn't in the running to acquire ProximalData to add a server side caching solution to the Nexsan line to improve the capabilities of those storage arrays.  That makes me wonder if this smaller market segment isn't going through some consolidation; will we see an Imation + Samsung merger or sale of various business units to one another?

No word in the blog post about Samsungs plans for ProximalData, normally you get the "business as usual" slop flung around but nothing of the sorts, stay tuned to find out if you can still buy AutoCache on its own or if you will be seeing the product rolled into another solution.

Congratulations to the folks at ProximalData on the acquisition, I will be interested to see what happens with them and Samsung going forward.
