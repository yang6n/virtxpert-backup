Recently the team I am on has been looking to adopt a more agile like approach to our projects, compared to previous years where it was more or less a waterfall methodology. Now in a text book agile environment you would start a sprint with a planning meeting on a Friday. In that planning meeting you would have, or create, a list of tasks in your backlog, ensure they are well defined (to your definition of "done") and assign them to each of the team members. Each day during the sprint you would then hold a standup each day to check in on work in progress and identify any pitfalls or problems and attempt to rectify those. You wrap up the sprint with a review meeting where work is demoed and a retrospective where team members give feedback on the sprint, which leads into another planning meeting for the next sprint. While in many cases this can be followed quite closely, you also need to consider your actual team and business requirements around your approach.

As we have experimented with an agile approach we started with a text book version of a sprint, holding our planning meeting to kick things off, daily stand ups, and wrapping up with review and retrospective meetings. After our 2nd or 3rd sprint we ditched the retrospective meeting, as we found with our team dynamic we were "retrospective" on the fly, that is identifying what worked, what didn't, and new possible opportunities for improvement. Now on a larger or more diverse team spread across multiple departments this might be something you chose to keep. Were we wrong to drop it? Some people I have talked to said yes, but I always go back to business requirements. Our job is to be more efficient, not follow a book that says we need to follow a specific process. In addition to dropping the retrospective, we also switched to 3 stand ups per week; dropping 1 in favor of a call with a larger group that generally proves informational and an "as needed" Friday stand up (quite honestly by Friday I'm spent), if someone is having a problem or we are getting close to a deadline we might have that Friday stand up, but if things are progressing as planned we generally skip it. Again, we are not following the text book examples of agile, but rather adopting the methodology as it applies to our work, team, and requirements.

As the team has grown, we are now more aware of the work we are each doing, able to avoid duplication of effort, be more consistent across our work, and have a clear goal as to what we are working on each day, rather than knowing we have an end date 2 or 3 months down the road. For those that have adopted an agile approach, what do you think? Do you need to have a meeting for the sake of a meeting, force fitting your workflow into the text book definition of the process or do you adopt the methodology to your team?
