I picked up the Thermaltake Chaser A21 case for my lab, due in large part to the number of drive bays so I could cram the case full of SSDs and HDDs.  After getting though most of the motherboard and power supply install, I can say I'm pretty disappointed.

<strong>Pros</strong>
<ul>
	<li>While the case is very light, it is actually quite sturdy.  I thought after first picking it up it would almost be too flimsy to use but it is actually quite durable.</li>
	<li>The bottom mount power bay fit my Raidmax 600AF perfectly</li>
	<li>Mounts for multiple case fans, check your motherboard to see how many you can support.  My TA970 AM3+ supports 2 without the need for splitters/adapters.</li>
	<li>Tool-less drive bays and side panels</li>
	<li>Front panel USB 3, check if your motherboard has a connector for that, the TA970 AM3+ does not.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cons</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The bottom mount power supply, while nice, means I had to run the +12v power connector across the motherboard, not idea.</li>
	<li>There is only space for 1x 2.5" drive, which screws into the bottom of the case so you'll need to purchase adapters to mount more than 1</li>
	<li>It only ships with a single case fan</li>
	<li>The cable clips built into the case are too thin and snap easily</li>
</ul>
Not sure if this is a con for the case, or the TA970 ATX motherboard but the standoff motherboard mounts in the middle of the case are about 2" away from the end of the actual motherboard.  Again not sure if thats the motherboards fault or the cases fault.

<strong>Summary</strong>

The con's list is a bit long, and even though its only $60 + shipping and tax you can likely do much better than this case.  It's not a bad case, just not a good one.  After writing this review I think I'll be returning this case in exchange for the Corsair 230T which can mount 4x 3.5" and 4x 2.5" drives simultaneously and comes with 3 case fans, which offsets the cost of additional case fans you would need to buy for the A21.
