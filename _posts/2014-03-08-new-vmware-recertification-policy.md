VMware has announced, like many other technical certifications, that you will now have to re-certify yourself every two years.  My initial reaction was that of anger and frustration, but as I thought about it and read more on the new VMware recertification policy its fairly reasonable.

You can find the official recertification policy here:  <a href="http://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=46667&amp;ui=www_cert" target="_blank">http://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=46667&amp;ui=www_cert</a>

The tl;dr version is you have two years to pass a VCP or higher level test in order to remain certified.  For example, if you passed your VCP5-DCV on January 2nd 2014 and took no other certification tests, you would need to re-take it, or another VCP5 level certification such as the Desktop or Cloud VCP by January 2nd 2016.

However, if you took the VCAP5-DCD for example on June 1st 2014, you would have until June 1st 2016 to pass another exam.

What I do not like, or appreciate is losing the validation that you previously passed a certification at a certain level, and a certain version.  At the very least, I should still be able to claim I am a VCP5-DCV since I had passed the test.  I'd be happy to be required to list the certification date on my resume or blog so companies looking to hire me know when I took the test, after all technology is ever evolving.

Losing the certification all together is why I no longer take any Cisco certifications.  The level of effort required, only to lose it is not worth the effort in my opinion.  With new versions of vSphere coming out every few years, i'd likely be taking the VCP6-DCV sooner or later anyways.  At the very least it will force me to re-think how far I spread out certifications.  Its been almost a year since I took my VCAP5-DCD and am going to schedule my VCAP5-DCA soon so at least I'll have two more years to figure out if I stay the course with certifications.

What I'd like to see, and I'll propose to the email address listed on the official VMware:
<ul>
	<li>Change from 2 to 3 years.  Although the 2 year window is from your most recent passed test including VCAPs; not everyone may want or feel they are ready for a VCAP level test.  Moving it to 3 years ensures the certification stays valid through a major release.</li>
	<li>Increase the value of the certification.  Right now, in order to study for advanced tests you really need a lab.  Why don't VCPs get NFR licenses of Enterprise Plus?  This would help people with their VCP continue to improve through experience hands on experience in their labs.</li>
	<li>Allow past people to keep their certifications.  While I understand you want to keep your certified community current, the importance of older VCP and VCAP's will take care of themselves.  Start the 2 or 3 year expiration on version 6 of the certification.</li>
	<li>Keep version numbers:  While VMware has not said they are taking them away, many have suggested taking the version number away.  I'd be fine with losing access to the VCP portal after 3 years and keeping my certification and version designation to show I have experience in a particular version.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Summary</strong>

While its certainly disappointing to know I could lose the certification, its also understandable.  VMware wants the people representing the technology to stay current.  What are your thoughts?  Will you continue to pursue VMware certifications?
