VMware vSphere comes with features that help you prepare a robust foundation to build virtual environments. You might have an already-built vSphere deployment, but managing the resources of your vSphere environment is crucial in order to save time and improve productivity.

This practical guide provides readers with a high-level understanding of the various components, methodologies and general best practices for maintaining and managing resources in a virtual environment.

Readers will begin the book with an explanation of the requirements for ESXi, the groundwork for VMware vSphere, and move through a comprehensive study of how resources are supplied. We’ll then progress with showing you the characteristics that enable resource and virtual machine availability.

With a solid understanding of the requirements to build and run your environment, you then move on to understanding how ESXi manages resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and networks for multiple virtual machines and how it ensures resource availability. Finally, you will be made aware of the options available with Vmware vSphere to automate and monitor your environment.

Readers will go through a learning curve of understanding the components, identifying the course of action, and putting it to practice.  Check out the <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/9781782170464_Chapter_02.pdf?utm_source=packtpub&amp;utm_medium=free&amp;utm_campaign=pdf" target="_blank">sample chapter here</a>.

<span style="color: #000000;">This book is a great resource for users getting started with vSphere and trying to understand the principles of resource management in shared computing environments. Virtualization on vSphere introduces lots of new concepts and this book does a great job explaining those concepts, required licensing and specific vSphere features. It is a must read for beginners, small deployment administrators and admins with growing deployments of vSphere.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="color: #000000;">The book isn’t very long to read as it only has 4 chapters, but I liked the format where the author </span><strong style="color: #000000;">present a feature and right after he gives you an examples with screenshots how-to use it in real life!</strong><span style="color: #000000;"> This is not simple theoretical or technical guide, but Jonathan shares his experience and tips that he has learnt so far with vSphere so it’s very valuable. </span>

<blockquote><span style="color: #000000;">The book has four chapters and the main theme of it is the management of resources in a VMware virtualization platform, where a practical but specific analysis is done and well detailed how these resources should be managed. </span>
