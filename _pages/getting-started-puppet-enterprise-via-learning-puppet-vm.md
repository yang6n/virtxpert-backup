For those interested in learning Puppet Enterprise, but haven't had the time, there is a prepackaged VM, which will deploy a full Puppet Enterprise Master VM.  I wasn't aware this existed until recently, so figured others may not and wanted to share.  Simply head to the <a href="http://info.puppetlabs.com/download-learning-puppet-VM.html" target="_blank">download page</a>, download the VM and import it into your preferred tool (supports, VMware ESXi, Workstation, Fusion, VirtualBox etc...).  Once the VM is imported, turn it on and your done!  Well not really done, now you have to learn how to use it (but thats the point of downloading it)!

The console of the Puppet Learning VM provides the URL and username/password (puppet@example.com / learningpuppet), head on over and start automating!  There is also a series of posts available at <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/learning/" target="_blank">http://docs.puppetlabs.com/learning/</a>
