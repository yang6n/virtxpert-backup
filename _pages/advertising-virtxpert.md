Virtxpert is a virtualization blog by Jonathan Frappier, an active member of the VMware community - I was selected vExpert in 2013 and 2014, EMC Elect in 2014 and as a PernixPro in 2014.  I have also achieved several certifications including EMC Cloud Architect (EMCCAe), VMware Certified Advanced Professional in Data Center Design (VCAP5-DCD) and VMware Certified Professional (VCP5-DCV).  Packages range from three months to 12 month.  Special packages include white papers, webinars and speaking at local community events such as the Boston VMUG and New England VTUG.
